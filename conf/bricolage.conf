# Apache Settings. HTTPD_VERSION selects which version of Apache to use; by
# default this is 'apache', which means version 1.3.34 or later, but it can be
# set to 'apache2' instead for Apache version >= 2.0.55. APACHE_BIN is the
# location of the Apache server executable, and APACHE_CONF is the location of
# the Apache configuration file. LISTEN_PORT is the port on which Bricolage
# will listen for connections. You must also tell Apache to listen on this
# port in the configuration file specified in APACHE_CONF (using Listen, Port,
# or BindAddress). SSL_ENABLE defines the type of SSL support available (Off,
# mod_ssl, apache_ssl). SKIP_SSN_REDIRECT tells Bricolage not to get fancy
# when SSL_ENABLE is true and it's doing a redirect. In such a case, it will
# redirect without specifying an alternate port. SSL_PORT defines the port on
# which Bricolage will listen for https server. It defaults to 443.
# ALWAYS_USE_SSL is disabled if not specified. It forces Bricolage to always
# use SSL for user connections and does not give the user the option of just
# using SSL for login. NAME_VHOST is the IP address on which the virtual host
# name specified in the VHOST_SERVER_NAME directive will respond. If you
# change the LISTEN_PORT and/or SSL_PORT numbers, remember to also change them
# in httpd.conf and vice versa.

# Bric::App::ApacheConfig" line in httpd.conf to "PerlModule

# Authentication settings. AUTH_TTL is the amount of time, in seconds, a user

# encrypt the authentication cookie information in a double-MD5 hashing

# who might have seen it before can't reverse-engineer the authentication
# cookie. AUTH_ENGINES is a space-delimited list of the authentication engines
# to use when a user logs in. Each engine will be tried in the order listed.
# Possible values are "Internal" and "LDAP". The default is "Internal". The
# LOGIN_LENGTH and PASSWD_LENGTH settings specify the minimum length of a user

# LDAP_BASE is the DN that will be used as the base for the search for the
# user. LDAP_UID_ATTR identifies the attribute of the LDAP record that
# contains the user name. Set LDAP_FILTER to a an extra filter for searching
# for the user record. If you want to allow only the members of a particular
# group to access Bricolage, set LDAP_GROUP to the DN of the group, and set
# LDAP_MEMBER_ATTR so the name of the attribute identifying each member of the

# Distribution settings. ENABLE_DIST, if set to 'yes' or 'on' or '1', tells

# local application process. If ENABLE_DIST is any other value, it is assumed
# that the distribution Engine is running elsewhere. The default is '1' if
# ENABLE_DIST is unspecified. DIST_ATTEMPTS tells the distribution engine how
# many times to attempt to distribute a resource before giving up. The default
# is 3. PREVIEW_LOCAL tells Bricolage to preview stories from its own Apache
# process. If set to 'yes' or 'on' or '1', it will use its own process for
# previewing. Otherwise, it will use a server from a destination with the
# "Preview" checkbox checked for previews.
#
# If PREVIEW_LOCAL is active, you must be sure that SYS_USER has write access
# to MASON_COMP_ROOT/data/preview. The default is "1". PREVIEW_MASON tells
# Bricolage to use Mason for local previews. Only enable this directive if
# the files you create with your Templates contain Mason code. This directive
# has no effect unless PREVIEW_LOCAL is active. Disabled by
# default. DEF_MEDIA_TYPE designates the default media type for assets where
# Bricolage cannot ascertain the media type. Defaults to "text/html" if not
# specified.
#
# Set ENABLE_SFTP_MOVER or ENABLE_WEBDAV_MOVER to 'yes' or 'on' or 1, to tell
# the API that the distribution engine can distribute resources by SFTP or by
# the WebDAV protocol. Both are disabled by default. Using either the SFTP or
# the WebDAV mover requires some manual installation; perldoc Bric::Admin for
# details.
#
# Setting SFTP_MOVER_CIPHER will force the SFTP mover to use that cipher when
# distributing resources via SFTP. Consult the Net::SSH2 documentation
# for a current list of ciphers. If it is set to 0, the default cipher will be
# used. More ciphers can be specified by separating them with commas.
#
# For key-based authentication, set SFTP_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE and
# SFTP_PUBLIC_KEY_FILE with the full path to the key files. As of this
# writing, Net::SSH2 supports SFTP_KEY_TYPE values of 'ssh-rsa' and 'ssh-dss'.
# The username and private key password (if any) must be entered in the
# Bricolage interface when setting up the destination.
#
# QUEUE_PUBLISH_JOBS tells Bricolage to drop all jobs into the Distribution
# queue on publish, rather than trying to run them immediately, which is the
# default.
#
# FTP_UNLINK_BEFORE_MOVE must be set to Yes for some FTP and SFTP servers
# (e.g. pure-ftpd has been reported to need this, and sshd less then version 5
# requires this) to correctly handle uploads of already existing files: when
# publishing via FTP, Bricolage first creates a temporary file, then moves

# FTP settings. ENABLE_FTP_SERVER enables the Bricolage virtual server, which

# behavior; temlates are simply put into the user's workspace and template
# sandbox when uploaded, unless they're uploaded with ".deploy" appended to
# their file names. Assign an IP address to FTP_ADDRESS to force the FTP
# server to listen only on that address; by default the FTP server will listen
# on all local IP addresses. FTP_PORT is the port that the FTP server will
# listen on. Defaults to 2121 if not specified. FTP_DEBUG forces the FTP
# server to write a lote of debugging data to its log. Enable this directive
# and tail the log if your FTP server is acting up. FTP_LOG specifies the
# location of the FTP log. Defaults to $BRICOLAGE_ROOT/ftp.log if not

## WYSIWYG CONFIGURATION
##

# Bricolage supports several "what you see is what you get" (WYSIWYG) text
# editors, which can be used in place of traditional textareas.  These fields
# allow word processor-like editing, but introduce HTML formatting into the
# content, which some consider to be a Bad Thing.  Due to the licenses of these
# editors, you will need to download and install (read: untar) the editors
# yourself.  Download the latest version from the URLs below and extract them
# into the corresponding folders.
#
# The currently supported editors are "htmlArea" (discontinued), JS-Quicktags
# (more of an HTML tag helper), "Xinha" (recommended), and FCKeditor. All but

# FCKeditor Configuration

# You can include the complete configuration as pure JavaScript on a single
# line for this configuration directive. To see what all you can set see the
# FCKeditor configuration documentation:

#
# Bricolage uses the "Default" toolbar set; this is the configuration it uses
# if the FCKEDITOR_CONFIG directive is not in this file. As a further example
# of what can be done with this directive, the SpellChecker configuration has
# also been set, but it is commented out. Consult Bric::Admin for details on
# configuration spellcheck.
