# Authentication settings. AUTH_TTL is the amount of time, in seconds, a user

# Distribution settings. ENABLE_DIST, if set to 'yes' or 'on' or '1', tells
# the API that the distribution engine can distribute resources within the
# local application process. If ENABLE_DIST is any other value, it is assumed
# that the distribution Engine is running elsewhere. The default is '1' if
# ENABLE_DIST is unspecified. DIST_ATTEMPTS tells the distribution engine how
# many times to attempt to distribute a resource before giving up. The default
# is 3. PREVIEW_LOCAL tells Bricolage to preview stories from its own Apache
# process. If set to 'yes' or 'on' or '1', it will use its own process for
# previewing. Otherwise, it will use a server from a destination with the
# "Preview" checkbox checked for previews.
#
# If PREVIEW_LOCAL is active, you must be sure that SYS_USER has write access
# to MASON_COMP_ROOT/data/preview. The default is "1". PREVIEW_MASON tells
# Bricolage to use Mason for local previews. Only enable this directive if
# the files you create with your Templates contain Mason code. This directive
# has no effect unless PREVIEW_LOCAL is active. Disabled by
# default. DEF_MEDIA_TYPE designates the default media type for assets where
# Bricolage cannot ascertain the media type. Defaults to "text/html" if not
# specified.
#
# Set ENABLE_SFTP_MOVER or ENABLE_WEBDAV_MOVER to 'yes' or 'on' or 1, to tell
# the API that the distribution engine can distribute resources by SFTP or by
# the WebDAV protocol. Both are disabled by default. Using either the SFTP or
# the WebDAV mover requires some manual installation; perldoc Bric::Admin for
# details. If you enable SFTP, set SFTP_HOME to a directory containing your
# SSH keys and with permisssions appropriate for SYS_USER to access. Setting
# ENABLE_SFTP_V2 to 'yes' will cause the SFTP mover to try SSH protocol 2
# before protocol 1; otherwise, it first tries protocol 1. Setting
# SFTP_MOVER_CIPHER will force the SFTP mover to use that cipher when
# distributing resources via SFTP. Consult the Net::SSH::Perl documentation
# for a current list of ciphers. If it is set to 0, the default cipher will be
# used.
#
# QUEUE_PUBLISH_JOBS tells Bricolage to drop all jobs into the Distribution
# queue on publish, rather than trying to run them immediately, which is the
# default.
#
# FTP_UNLINK_BEFORE_MOVE must be set to Yes for some FTP servers (e.g.
# pure-ftpd has been reported to need this) to correctly handle uploads of
# already existing files: when publishing via FTP, Bricolage first creates a
# temporary file, than moves this temp file over the existing, older file,
# overwriting it. Some servers do not support renaming to existing files, so
# the original one must be deleted first.

# by said process. MIN_SHARE_SIZE Indicates the minimum amount of shared
# memory the process must employ to not be considered a candidate for
# termination. MAX_UNSHARED_SIZE Sets a limit on the amount of unshared memory
# a process may consume to not be a candidate for termination. Set
# MIN_SHARE_SIZE or MAX_UNSHARE_SIZE to "No" or "Off" or "0" to disable either
# respective test. See the Apache::SizeLimit manpage for additional info. All

# Full search setting. By default, Bricolage looks for search strings in the
# database only at the beginning of the fields. The reason for this is that,
# if it looks for the search string anywhere within the result fields, it
# cannot use any database indexes, and therefore could be much slower. But it
# depends on how many records there are. Set this configuration directive to
# "On" or "Yes" or "1" if you wish to enable the slower subsearch approach --

# Workflow desk transfers. By default, a desk that is shared between workflows

# Output Channel file naming settings. All files burned to the file system

# On by default.

ENABLE_OC_ASSET_ASSOCIATION = Yes

STORY_URI_WITH_FILENAME = No

# Story slugs. Disable ALLOW_SLUGLESS_NONFIXED if you want to prevent
# non-fixed (i.e. non-Cover) stories from being slugless. Enabled by default.

# a slug automatically generated from the title. Note that if you enable

# FTP settings. ENABLE_FTP_SERVER enables the Bricolage virtual server, which
# can be used to edit, update, and deploy templates by uploading them via
# FTP. This requires running the bin/bric_ftpd script, as well. Disabled by
# default. FTP_DEPLOY_ON_UPLOAD forces the FTP server to deploy templates as
# soon as they're uploaded to the FTP server. By default, this is not the
# behavior; temlates are simply put into the user's workspace and template
# sandbox when uploaded, unless they're uploaded with ".deploy" appended to
# their file names. Assign an IP address to FTP_ADDRESS to force the FTP
# server to listen only on that address; by default the FTP server will listen
# on all local IP addresses. FTP_PORT is the port that the FTP server will
# listen on. Defaults to 2121 if not specified. FTP_DEBUG forces the FTP
# server to write a lote of debugging data to its log. Enable this directive
# and tail the log if your FTP server is acting up. FTP_LOG specifies the
# location of the FTP log. Defaults to $BRICOLAGE_ROOT/ftp.log if not
# specified. FTP_PID_FILE specifies the location of the file storing the FTP
# server's PID, which will then be used to shut down the FTP server. Defaults
# to $BRICOLAGE_ROOT/ftp.pid if not specified. For more information on the
