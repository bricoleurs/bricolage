bric_ftpd - Bricolage virtual FTP server

=head1 Synopsis

  su nobody -c "bric_ftpd -S"

=head1 Description

This program controls the Bricolage vitual FTP server, which can be used to
allow access to Bricolage templates. This may provide a more comfortable
development environment for programmers working on templates. Many editors
provide FTP modes that make editing files via FTP almost as easy as editing
files locally (ange-ftp for Emacs, for example).

There are security risks to consider - FTP sends passwords unencrypted over
the network. If you are running Bricolage behind a firewall this might not be
a problem.

To enable the FTP server you'll need to install the Net::FTPServer Perl
module. After that you can configure the FTP server with the following
F<bricolage.conf> directives:

=over

=item *

B<ENABLE_FTP_SERVER:> Set this to 1 if you want to use the FTP
server. Defaults to 0.

=item *

B<FTP_PORT:> The port that the FTP server will run on. Users will need to know
this port to connect to the FTP server. Since you won't be running the server
as root you'll need to choose a port above 1024. Defaults to 2121.

=item *

B<FTP_ADDRESS:> Normally the FTP server will bind to all the available IP
addresses for your machine. If you set this variable then the server will only
bind to the specified address.

=item *

B<FTP_LOG:> Set this to the file where you want to FTP logs written
to. Defaults to C<$BRICOLAGE_ROOT/ftp.log> if not set.

=item *

B<FTP_PID_FILE:> Set this to the file where you want to the FTP daemon PID
stored. Defaults to C<$BRICOLAGE_ROOT/ftp.pid> if not set.

=item *

B<FTP_DEBUG:> If you set this to 1 you'll see a lot of useful tracing
information in the FTP logfile. This can help diagnose errors but is probably
only of interest to developers. Defaults to 0.

=back

Next you'll need to start the FTP server as the same user that Apache runs as.
For example, if you run Apache as "nobody" you would use this command to start
the FTP server:

  su nobody -c "bric_ftpd -S"

The C<-S> option to ftpd runs the FTP server in the background. For other
possibilities see the documentation for Net::FTPServer.

Once the server is up and running connect to it with an FTP client and start
editing templates. For more information see
L<Bric::Util::FTP::Server|Bric::Util::FTP::Server>.

To kill the FTP server in daemon mode, use the C<-k> option:

  su nobody -c bric_ftpd -k"
