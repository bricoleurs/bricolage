copy_gnome_icons

=head1 Synopsis

For icons files starting with "gnome-":

  copy_gnome_icons *.png

For icons files starting with "gnome-mime-":

  copy_gnome_icons --strip gnome-mime- *.png

=head1 Description

This script is designed to convert a collection of GNOME MIME type icons to
the Bricoalge root and to the naming convention used by Bricolage. The icons
will then be used by the Bricolage UI, assuming that the C<USE_THUMBNAILS>
F<bricolage.conf> directive has been enabled.

Be sure to set the C<$BRICOLAGE_ROOT> environment variable if it is anything
other than F</usr/local/bricolage>. The icons will bee installed into the
F<comp/media/mime> directory under the Bricolage root.

The icons are named exactly as the corresponding MIME types are named, with
the resulting PNG files installed in appropriate subdirectories. For example,
an icon named "gnome-text-html.png" will be copied to
F<comp/media/mime/text/html.png>.

This script was developed using the GNOME MIME type icons
(L<downloaded|http://developer.ximian.com/images/art-devel/mime-icons.tgz>,
linked to from the L<Ximian icons
page|http://developer.ximian.com/themes/icons/>), but appears as though it
would work with the files in a F<mimetypes> subdirectory of most PNG icon
distributions downloadable from the L<GNOME Icons
page|http://art.gnome.org/themes/icon/> (the "NoiaWarm" theme's 48 x 48 MIME
type icons look pretty nice with the Bricolage UI color scheme). Updates
happily accepted.

=head1 Options

=head2 C<--strip>

GNOME MIME type icon files typically start with a string that preceeds the
MIME type they're named for. Use the C<--strip> option to specify what that
string is that needs to be stripped from the file name. The remainder of the
file name is assumed to be the full MIME type name, with a dash in place of
the usual slash. So the GNOME MIME type icon file name for
"application/msword" might be F<gnome-application-msword.png> or
F<gnome-mime-application-msword.png> or something similar. In the former
example, the default value for C<--strip>, "gnome-", can be used to strip off
the "gnome-" and leave "appplication-msword.png". In the latter example
specify "gnome-mime-" for the C<--strip> option. Note that the C<--strip>
option can be a regular expression.
