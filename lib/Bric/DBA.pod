Bric::DBA - Bricolage Database Administration Guide.

=head1 Description

This guide is intended for the database administrator in charge of maintaining
the Bricolage PostgreSQL database.

=head1 Security

By default, PostgreSQL has pretty lax authentication settings, at least locally.
Client authentication is controlled by the file pg_hba.conf in the $PGDATA
directory, e.g., /usr/local/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf. The default settings allow
completely trusted connections to the server by any local user using either Unix
domain sockets or TCP/IP connections (although by default, PostgreSQL does not
bind to a TCP socket). These settings are as follows:

 local  all                                       trust
 host   all         127.0.0.1    255.255.255.255  trust

These settings allow anyone connecting via B<local> Unix domain sockets to
connect to B<all> databases in a completely B<trust>ed manor. They won't even
be prompted for a password! Similarly, B<host>s connecting from the local IP
address, B<127.0.0.1> with Mask B<255.255.255.255>, are completely B<trust>ed to
connect to B<all> databases.

While these settings are fine for limited local use (provided you trust all
users on the local system!), they are not good for a production environment. We
recommend that clients be required to provide a password -- and preferably that
it be encrypted. If the Bricolage web server runs on the local box and no other
box will need to connect, we recommend the following settings:

 local  all                                        md5
 # host  all         127.0.0.1    255.255.255.255  md5

These are similar to the defaults, except that they require a password, but the
password is sent over the wire encrypted using a simple challenge-response
protocol. We have commented out the B<host> entry because Bric is running
locally and can therefore rely solely on Unix domain sockets. (In this case, you
may also wish to remove the -i switch from the PostgreSQL startup script.)
Enable it if you find a need to connect locally via TCP/IP.

If you're running PostgreSQL on its own box, and Bricolage (or any subset of the
Bricolage application, such as the distribution server) runs on another box, you
will need to enable secure connections to that box. To limit the connections to
come from that single box, use this configuration:

 local  all                                         md5
 host   all           127.0.0.1    255.255.255.255  md5
 host   bric_dbname   192.168.1.2  255.255.255.255  md5

Where the IP address B<192.168.1.2> is the IP address of the box running
Bricolage, and B<255.255.255.255> is its mask. If you feel comfortable allowing
more broad access to the server -- say you have a number of database
applications running on multiple servers in the same subnet to connect -- try
the following configuration:

 local  all                                         md5
 host   all           127.0.0.1    255.255.255.255  md5
 host   bric_dbname   192.168.1.0  255.255.255.255  md5

Here the B<192.168.1.0> IP address represents the 192.168.1 subnet on which the
multiple clients live.

Many other combinations of authentication settings are of course possible via
the flexible pg_hba.con configuration syntax, but the above are our recommended
settings for ensuring the security and integrity of your data. Refer to the
L<PostgreSQL documentation|http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/> for
more details, including other levels of encryption.

=head1 Backup and Restore

PostgreSQL supports backups and restores via its pg_dump, pg_dumpall, and psql
utilities. File system backups are also a good idea. We recommend that you use
the pg_dumpall utility on a regular basis to backup the Bricolage database:

  pg_dumpall > outfile

This program outputs a series of SQL statements that can then be reloaded into
the database using the psql utility:

  psql < infile

We recommend the use of pg_dumpall in order to preserve the the entire database
system. Read the pg_dumpall man page for more details. However, if you use your
PostgreSQL server for other databases, you may wish to place them on separate
backup schedules. In that case, use pg_dump to backup each of the databases,
including the Bricolage database:

  pg_dump bric_dbname > outfile

The restoration is the same as for the pg_dumpall file, except that you must be
sure to create the database and users, first.

  psql bric_dbname < infile

Read the pg_dump man page for more details. Note that neither pg_dump nor
pg_dumpall prevent database access by other processes (e.g., Bricolage), but
they will affect performance. It's a good idea to dump the file to a different
partition or disk or even server (since pg_dump and pg_dumpall can be used on
any server with access to the PostgreSQL server). Changes made to the database
during the process of the backup will not be backed up.

In either case, if your Bricolage database is getting big, you may wish to
compress the backupfile, or break it into smaller chunks. This can be done using
*nix system utilities. For example, to compress a backupfile, use gzip:

  pg_dumpall | gzip > filename.gz
  gunzip -c filename.gz | psql

You can also use split to break the backup file into smaller chunks. This
example breaks the file up into 1 MB chunks:

  pg_dumpall | split -b 1m - filename
  cat filename.* | psql

New to PostgreSQL is the custom dump format. You can use it to compress
dumpfiles on the fly. Consult the pg_dump and pg_dumpall man pages for more
information.

File system backups are another option, and may in fact be useful as a backup
backup methodology. Use whatever methodology for file system backups that you
prefer. Here is an example using tar:

  tar -cf backup.tar /usr/local/pgsql/data

There are two restrictions to file system backups, however. First, the
PostgreSQL server B<must> be shut down during the backup or during restoration.
Second, you can't do selective backups of databases or tables, only the whole
database cluster.

For more detail on PostgreSQL backup and restore, please consult the
L<PostgreSQL documentation|http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/>.

=head1 Write-Ahead Logging (WAL)

Write Ahead Logging (WAL) is a standard approach to transaction logging. It is
automatically enabled in the PostgreSQL server. WAL ensures that the log is
written before database records are altered, thereby minimizing the number of
disk writes; and in the event of a crash, the database can be recovered using
using the log.

Please consult the PostgreSQL documentation for more information on configuring
WAL and recovering databases with WAL.

=head1 Tuning

PostgreSQL requires a certain amount of tuning to operate at optimum
efficiency. The default settings for a new PostgreSQL installation are very
conservative, and are intended to make sure that the postmaster will be able
to start up so that you can get started setting up your databases. It is not,
however, a very useful setup for a production database environment, since it
severely limits the amount of shared memory that the postmaster can allocate
for itself.

To tune PostgreSQL, first determine the amount of memory you want to give to
your running PostgreSQL server. In a production environment where PostgreSQL
is running on a dedicated machine, this will be the entire memory minus the
amount needed to run kernel services. In other situations it will pay to
observe the machine while running Bricolage and whatever other services are
necessary, and make a guesstimate of the amount of memory you are willing to
give to the database server. The amount of memory you decide on may be
considered your "available RAM."

=head2 Shared Buffers

After you have decided on the amount of available RAM to allocate, there are
several settings to make. First is the shared memory setting, which in
PostgreSQL can be set via the C<shared_buffers> setting in the
F<postgresql.conf> file in your PostgreSQL data directory. This setting
controls the number of shared buffers that the database server can use. Each
buffer is 8 KB. (Usually. Some OSs have different shared buffer settings
compiled into their kernels. Consult your server admin for details.)

It's important to remember that this is only a holding area, and I<not> the
total memory available to the server. As such, resist the urge to set this
number to a large portion of your RAM, as doing so will actually degrade
performance on many OSs. Members of the pgsql-performance mailing list have
found useful values in the range of 6% to 20% of available RAM, depending on
database size and number of concurrent queries.

Since Bricolage is a large database and we recommend the use of a server with
lots of RAM, you will likely want to set C<shared_buffers> to around 10%. In
the following example, we'll demonstrate how to set the value to 24576 (192
MB, or 10% of 2 GB RAM).

First you may need to set your kernel to allow for the shared memory
allocation. On a Red Hat Linux system, shared memory is controlled through
settings in F</etc/sysctl.conf>. So, for our example, where we've decided to
give PostgreSQL up to 192 MB of shared memory, here's how you would make the
kernel setting (note that the kernel setting is in bytes, so our setting is
C<192 * 1024 * 1024 = 201326592>):

  kernel.shmmax = 201326592

These settings can then be enabled by running C</sbin/sysctl -p>. See the
PostgreSQL L<Kernel
Resources|http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/interactive/kernel-resources.html>
documentation for more information on shared buffers and changing your
operating system's shared buffer settings. Now you can update your
F<postgresql.conf> file's shared memory buffers setting to take advantage of
this shared memory:

  shared_buffers = 24576

=head2 Work Memory

Next, it's probably also a good idea to boost your work memory to get a better
response time to the very large queries used to look up Bricolage objects. The
work memory has to do with number of concurrent queries. Never risk going over
total memory, or else PostgreSQL will go into swap and things will get
I<really> slow. Bricolage generally uses no more than three or four concurrent
queries, so 8 MB should be okay. Unlike C<shared_buffers>, the C<work_mem> (or
C<sort_mem>) setting is in KB buffers, so setting it to 8 MB would be:

  work_mem = 8192

The difficult issue with C<work_mem> is that more is needed for bigger
queries, but C<work_mem> is not shared, being allocated on a I<per-task>
basis. You do not, B<ever>, want to use more cumulative C<work_mem> than your
computer actually has, because it will go into swap and slow PostgreSQL down
to glacial speed.

Bricolage uses some complex queries that require 3 or even 4 sorts per query.
This means that you have to be prepared to have C<3 * work_mem> available for
each concurrent query. Overall, this means (with fudge factors) that when you
can calculate the maximum C<work_mem> it is completely safe to set as:
C<Available RAM / max_connections * 3>. But more than 12 MB C<work_mem> should
not be needed except on the largest Bricolage installations (5GB + database).

You must remember that if your Bricolage usage forces you to increase
C<max_connections>, then you will have to think about lowering
C<work_mem>...or buying more RAM.

=head2 Maximum Connections

Since Bricolage is a web application with persistent database connections, you
can likely decrease the value of the C<max_connections> setting in
F<postgresql.conf> To the maximum number of concurrent connections you'd
expect, plus a couple extra for good measure. In a very busy Bricolage
environment with 100s of users, that number is probably around 50. For less
busy installations, the number can be lower, but in any event, probably should
not be less than 8 (since you might have that many Apache processes running,
even on a single-user system).

If you're not sure what number to assign to the C<max_connections> directive,
watch your Bricolage server to see how many connections it holds to the
database to determine the optimum setting. Since there is an inverse relation
between C<max_connections> and C<work_mem>, lowering this number can also help
you to find a middle ground between a healthy value for C<work_mem> and
needing to reconfigure the kernel's SHMMAX (See L</"Shared Buffers">).

  max_connections = 50

=head2 Effective Cache Size

The effective cache size is the amount of memory available to PostgreSQL for
caching your database. This setting should be 2/3 - 3/4 the amount of
available RAM. This setting is typically set in 8 KB blocks. So for a system
with 2 GB available RAM where you want to allocate 75% for the effective cache
size, the number would be calculated C<2 * 1024 * 1024 * .75 / 8 = 196608>:

  effective_cache_size = 196608

=head2 Autovacuum

The C<autovacuum> directive turns on the autovacuum daemon included in
PostgreSQL. We strongly recommend that you take advantage of the autovacuum
feature in order to keep database performance optimal. See the L<autovacuum
documenation|http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/maintenance.html#AUTOVACUUM>
for details. To enable autovacuum, you I<must> set these direcives:

  stats_start_collector = on
  stats_row_level       = on
  autovacuum            = on

In PostgreSQL 8.3 and later autovacuum is enabled by default, but just in case, the
directives have changed:

  autovacuum   = on
  track_counts = on

If you enable C<autovacuum> but forget to enable C<stats_start_collector>
and/or C<stats_row_level>, or C<track_counts>, autovacuum will not actually
work. But it's not fatal; you'll just happen to see this warning if you're
watching your PostgreSQL log:

  WARNING: autovacuum not started because of misconfiguration
  HINT: Enable options "stats_start_collector" and stats_row_level".

So be sure to enable them!

Beyond these required settings, our current recommendation for running
autovacuum on a Bricolage database are to set the following directives:

  autovacuum_vacuum_threshold    = 300
  autovacuum_analyze_threshold   = 500
  autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor = 0.5

=head2 Maintenance Work Memory

The C<maintenance_work_mem> directive reserves memory for database maintenance
work, such as C<vacuum>ing the database. If your PostgreSQL server has a
decent amount of RAM (say 1-2 GB), increase the value of
C<maintenance_work_mem> to allow C<vacuum>s and other mainentance work to go
faster. We recommend 64 MB (set in KB):

  maintenance_work_mem = 65536

=head2 Maximum Free Space Map Pages

The C<max_fsm_pages> directive should be set relative to the amount of update
activity. No one is really sure how much daily update activity there is in a
typical Bricolage database, and the amount will likely vary from installation
to installation. However, if you're using C<pg_autovacuum> with a threshold of
30%, then you can set C<max_fsm_pages> to 30% of the expected quantity of
data pages.

The number of data pages is divided into 8 KB pages. So for a 1 GB database,
the number of data pages would be C<1024 * 1024 / 8 = 131072>. For each record
updated in the database, PostgreSQL must store a dead tuple. The C<fsm_map>
setting determines how much space is held open so that dead tuples don't crowd
the data pages. If you estimate 50% updates, then set C<max_fsm_pages> to
C<131072 * .5 = 65536>:

  max_fsm_pages = 65536

For a large database on a system with lots of memory, you can assign more. A
value of 75000 should be more than enough for expected activity in a 1 GB
database.

=head2 Genetic Query Optimizer

The Genetic Query Optimizer (or GEQO) is an algorithm that attempts to do
query planning without exhaustive searching. It can be very useful when you
execute a query with a lot of joins. Note, however, that GEQO queries
generally run more slowly than regular queries. In particular, in some
installations of Bricolage, templates calling C<<
Bric::Biz::Assset::Business::Story->list >> with a lot of parameters have been
found to really confuse the GEQO. For that reason, if you your templates pass
a parameters to C<< Bric::Biz::Assset::Business::Story->list >> that cause
many tables to be joined, we recommend that you increase the value of
C<geqo_threshold> to greater than the number of joined tables. In one
installation, we found that setting

  geqo_threshold = 15

reduced query times from 20 minutes or more to under a second. You'll know
that you need to tweak this setting when you find that publish jobs just go on
forever and never finish. Note, also, that such queries may run quickly in one
run, and then much longer in subsequent runs on the same connection. If you
don't notice execution times that are that slow, you can probably leave this
paramter alone.

=head1 More Performance Tips

Note: B<Do this at your own risk!!!>

Another common cause of poor performance in a PostgreSQL database is the
existence of very very large tables. Bricolage can sometimes have this sort of
problem since by design it is very conservative about eliminating old data. As
a result, certain tables tend to grow quite large.

For instance, if you notice that the Bricolage database has become quite large
you might decide that it makes sense to actually delete some of the old
data. In particular the C<job> table tends to grow quite large, with most of
the data actually not being used for much of anything, so from time to time we
do this:

  DELETE FROM member
  WHERE  class__id IN (54, 79, 80)
         AND id NOT IN (
           SELECT member__id
           FROM   job_member, job
           WHERE  job.id = job_member.object_id
                  AND (
                     executing = true
                     OR comp_time IS NULL
                  )
           );

  DELETE FROM job
  WHERE  executing = false
         AND (
           comp_time IS NOT NULL
           OR failed = true
         );

This can result in significant boosts in preview and publish performance,
since, for each job-related query, PostgreSQL will no longer have to load a
very very large index into memory, sometimes paging it several times. Of
course it also saves disk space.

Of course if you have some reason to generate reports on complete jobs you
won't be able to do this.
