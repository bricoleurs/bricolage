=head1 Description

This module accomplishes two tasks:

=over 4

=item 1

Manages the process of deploying and undeploying of templates through
C<deploy()> and C<undeploy()>.

=item 2

Manages the process of publishing and previewing business assets via the
C<publish()> and C<preview()> methods, respectively. The actual work of
publishing is done by one of Bric::Util::Burner's subclasses depending on the
C<burner_type> of the asset being published. See L<Bric::Util::Burner::Mason>
and L<Bric::Util::Burner::Template> for details.

=head1 Adding a New Burner

We anticipate that new Burner subclasses will be added to the system. Here's
a brief guide to adding a new Burner to Bricolage:

=over 4

=item *

Modify Bric::Biz::OutputChannel.

To use your Burner you'll need to be able to assign output channels to it. To
do this edit Bric::Biz::OutputChannel and add a constant for your burner. For
example, Bric::Util::Burner::Template's constant is C<BURNER_TEMPLATE>. Next,
edit the C<my_meths()> entry for the "burner" type to include an entry for
your constant.

=item *

Decide on a file naming scheme for your templating architecture. The file name
suffix or suffixes must be unique across Bricolage burners, as must the base
file name of your category templates. See the calls to _register_subclass() in
the other burner classes to ensure that your choices are unique. You must also
decide whether or not your category template file names will have suffixes. We
generally recommend that they don't, so as to prevent possible conflicts with
the names of element templates (see the Mason and PHP burners for an example).

=item *

Write the burner tests by implementing F</t/Bric/Util/Burner/Foo/DevTest.pm>.
See F</t/Bric/Util/Burner/Mason/DevTest.pm> for an example. You will need to
use the constant defined in Bric::Biz::OutputChannel and the file name
standards defined in the last step to have the base class,
F</t/Bric/Util/Burner/DevTest.pm>, properly create and load the test
templates.

You will also have to create the test templates. The templates go into the
same directory as the new F<DevTest.pm> file. For example, if you had elected
to go with the file suffix "foo" and gone with "cat_me" for your category
template name, and the category template does F<not> include the file suffix,
the templates you would need to create would be:

=over

=item F<cat_me>

The root-level category template. Port the Mason test's F<autohandler>
template.

=item F<sub_cat_me>

A subcategory template. This template will wrap the execution of the story
template and be wrapped by the execution of the F<cat_me> template. Port the
Mason test's F<sub_autohandler> template.

=item F<story.foo>

The story element template. Port the Mason test's F<story.mc> template.

=item F<page.foo>

A page subelement template. Port the Mason test's F<pull_quote.mc> template.
This template should be used from paginated content, which will result in the
output of two separate files for the test story.

=item F<pull_quote.foo>

The pull quote subelement template. Port the Mason test's F<pull_quote.mc>
template.

=item F<util.foo>

A utility template. Should be called from some other template, usually
F<cat_me>. Port from the Mason test's F<util.mc> template.

=back

=item *

Write Bric::Util::Burner::Foo.

You'll need to create a new subclass of Bric::Util::Burner that implements
three methods - C<new()>, C<chk_syntax()>, and C<burn_one()>. You can use an
existing subclasses as a model for the interface and implementation of these
methods. Make sure that when you execute your templates, you do it in the
name space reserved by the C<TEMPLATE_BURN_PKG> directive -- get this constant
by adding

  use Bric::Config qw(:burn);

to your new Burner subclass.

Your burner class will also need to call the C<_register_burner()> method when
it loads so as to register itself, its category base file name and its file
name suffix or suffixes. Again, see the existing subclasses for some examples.

=item *

Modify Bric::Util::Burner to load your burner subclass, provided the necessary
prerequisites are installed. For example, the PHP burner is loaded like so:

    require Bric::Util::Burner::PHP if eval { require PHP::Interpreter };

=item *

If all of your tests pass, you're done! You must have a freshly-built
Bricolage database to successfully run the tests. To just run your new
burner's tests, use this command:

  perl inst/runtests.pl -V t/Bric/Util/Burner/Foo/DevTest.pm

When that's working, make sure that I<all> tests pass by running:

  make devtest TEST_VERBOSE=1

=item *

Create a patch using the instructions in L<Bric::Hacker|Bric::Hacker> and send
them to the Bricolage developer's mailing list!

=item *

Profit.

=head1 Interface

In addition to the class and object methods documented below,
Bric::Util::Burner can export a number of constants. These constants are used
for comparing the values stored in the C<mode> property of a burner
object. They can be imported individually, or by using the C<:modes> or
C<:all> export tags. The supported constants are:

=over

=item C<PUBLISH_MODE>

The burner object is in the process of publishing an asset.

=item C<PREVIEW_MODE>

The burner object is in the process of previewing an asset.

=item C<SYNTAX_MODE>

The burner object is in the process of checking the syntax of a template.

=item my $burner_class = Bric::Util::Burner->class_for_ext($ext);

Returns the name of the burner class that handles templates with the extension
passed in. The extension must be the full extension name without with the ".",
such as "mc" or "tmpl".

B<Throws:> NONE.

B<Side Effects:> NONE.

B<Notes:> NONE.

=item my $burner_class = Bric::Util::Burner->class_for_cat_fn($filename);

Returns the name of the burner class that handles category templates with the
base file name passed in. The file name must be the base file name, omitting
any exception, such as "autohandler" or "category".

B<Throws:> NONE.

B<Side Effects:> NONE.

B<Notes:> NONE.

=item my $burner_class = Bric::Util::Burner->cat_fn_has_ext($filename);

Returns true if the category template with the base file name C<$filename> has
a file extension, and false if it doesn't. For example Mason category templates
have no extension, so this method returns false for the C<$filename>
"autohandler". On the other hand, HTML::Template templates do have extensions,
so this method returns true for the C<$filename> "category".

B<Throws:> NONE.

B<Side Effects:> NONE.

B<Notes:> NONE.

=item my $file_types = Bric::Util::Burner->list_file_types($burner_id)

Returns an array reference of array references of burner file name extensions
mapped to labels for each. Suitable for use in select widgets. Pass in a
Burner ID (such as C<BURNER_MASON>, as exported by Bric::Biz::OutputChannel)
to get back an array reference of only the burner file name extensions
available for that burner.

=item Bric::Util::Burner->flush_another_queue

Goes through the list of documents queued for publish by C<publish_another()>
and schedules them to be published. This method is called by the cleanup
handler and/or by C<bric_queued>, and therefore not generally of interest to
template developers (unless you want to flush the queue to force a publish
after every call to C<publish_another()>, but be careful! You might force the
publication of documents passed to C<publish_another()> by other templates in
the same request!).

not bother to preview the document if it's the same story as the currently
burning story. The supported arguments are:

=item $burner->publish_another($ba);

  $burner->publish_another($ba);
  $burner->publish_another($ba, $publish_time);
  $burner->publish_another($ba, $publish_time, $anytime);

Designed to be called from within a template, this method schedules the
publication of a document other than the one currently being published. This
is useful when a template for one document type needs to trigger the
publication of another document. Look up that document via the Bricolage API
and then pass it to this method to have it scheduled for publication at the
same time as the story currently being published.

If the mode isn't C<PUBLISH_MODE> or if the document passed in is the same
story as the currently burning story, the publish will not actually be
executed. Pass in an ISO-8601 datetime string to specify a date and time
different than the current story to publish the document at a different time.
Pass in a true value as the third argument to trigger the publish in any mode,
including C<PREVIEW_MODE> (not recommended).

If the document to be published has been published before, then the
previously-published version will be published instead of the current version.
This will help prevent removing stories from workflow while users are working
on them.

Note that any values stored in the C<notes> attribute of the current burner
will be copied to the publish job, and will therefore be available in
templates when the other document is published, but B<only> if the publish
date and time is before I<now> and if the C<QUEUE_PUBLISH_JOBS>
F<bricolage.conf> directive is not enabled.

B<Throws:> NONE.

B<Side Effects:> NONE.

B<Notes:>

All documents passed to C<publish_another()> are stored in a publish queue
internal to Bric::Util::Burner; they will B<not> be published immediately. The
queue may be cleared and all documents in it published by calling the
C<flush_another_queue()> class method.

You do not need to flush the publish queue from your templates, however,
unless you want to always force an immediate republish. The reason for this is
so that, if the bulk publication of a lot of stories at once causes the same
document to be repeatedly passed to C<publish_another>, it will only be
published once per Apache request or per poll time by C<bric_queued>. So in
principal, you don't need to worry about this at all.

This method is designed to be called from within a template. When passed a
true value, it causes the burner to burn the current story and page again,
creating another file. This is useful for creating multi-file output without
extra paginated subelements. For example, if you need to create an index of
stories, and you only want to list 10 on a page over multiple pages, you can
use this method to force the burner to burn as many pages as you need to get
the job done.

When the burner prepares to burn the page again, it resets the C<burn_again>
attribute. So you'll need to set it for every page for which another page
burned.

Returns a URI object representing Bricolage's best guess as to the appropriate
URI to use to link to the story or media object passed as an argument. See the
L<URI|URI> docs for information on its interface. The semantics that
C<best_uri()> uses to create the URI are as follows:

First, it checks to see if the asset's Site ID is the same as the the Site ID
for the current output channel. If it is, then the URI is returned without the
protocol or server name, but formatted for either the current output channel
or for the document's primary output channel.

If the document isn't in the current output channel's site, C<best_uri()>
looks for an alias to the document in the current output channel's site. If
there is one the alias is used to create the URI, and the URI is returned
without the protocol or server name, but formatted for either the current
output channel or for the alias' primary output channel.

And finally, if the document is in another site and there is no alias in the
current site, C<best_uri()> will return a full URI with the prtocol and the
document's site's domain name, formatted according to the settings of the
document's primary output channel.

The C<notes()> method provides a place to store burn data data, giving
template developers a way to share data among multiple burns over the course
of publishing a single story in a single category to a single output
channel. Any data stored here persists for the lifetime of the burner object,
as well as to any burners generated by calls to C<publish_another()> or
C<preview_another()>. Use C<clear_notes()> to manually clear the notes.

Conceptually, C<notes()> contains a hash of key-value pairs. C<notes($key,
$value)> stores a new entry in this hash. C<notes($key)> returns a previously
stored value. C<notes()> without any arguments returns a reference to the
entire hash of key-value pairs.

C<notes()> is similar to the mod_perl method C<< $r->pnotes() >>. The main
differences are that this C<notes()> can be used in a non-mod_perl environment
(such as when a story is published by F<bric_queued>), and that its lifetime is
tied to the lifetime of the burner object.

Protected method only called by Burner subclasses when they're loaded. This
method registers the subclasses, along with their Bric::Biz::OutputChannel
constants, file names, and file extenstions. Note that the C<category_fn> and
must be unique among all burners, as must the file extensions passed via the
C<exts> directive.
