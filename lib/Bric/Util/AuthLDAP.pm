=head1 Name

Bric::Util::AuthLDAP - Bricolage LDAP authentication

=head1 Synopsis

In F<bricolage.conf>

  AUTH_ENGINES = LDAP

=head1 Description

This module provides an interface for the Bricolage to authenticate users
against an LDAP server. If one of the authentication engines assigned to the
C<AUTH_ENGINES> F<bricolage.conf> directive is "LDAP", then this module will
be loaded by the user class and used for authentication. See the Bric::Admin
L<Bric::Admin/"Authentication Configuration"|Authentication Configuration>
section for more in-depth information on authentication engines, as well as
its L<Bric::Admin/"LDAP Configuration"|LDAP Configuration> section for the
specifics on configuring Bricolage to authenticate against your LDAP server.

This module is used internally by
L<Bric::Biz::Person::User|Bric::Biz::Person::User>; it should not be used
directly.

=head1 Interface

=head2 Class Methods

=head3 authenticate

  Bric::Util::AuthLDAP->authenticate($user, $password);

Pass a user object and a password to this method to authenticate the user to
an LDAP server with the password. Returns true if the password validates, and
false if it does not.

Note that a user may successfully authenticate to the LDAP server but still
not successfully authenticate to Bricolage if you've set the L<LDAP_GROUP>
directive to the DN of a user grop on your LDAP server. In such a case, the
user must also be a member of that group to use Bricolage. This provides a
simple allow and disallow users to access Bricolage from within LDAP. Users
must still exist within Bricolage with the same username, however. A user that
can successfully authenticate to the LDAP server will not be able to
authenticate in Bricolage until a the corresponding Bricolage user object has
been created.

=head3 set_password

  Bric::Util::AuthLDAP->set_password($user, $password);

This method is a no-op; it simply returns the invocant. It is not currently
possible to change LDAP passwords from Bricolage. This functionality may
be added in the future.

=cut

# XXX No-op. We cannot change passwords because the user changing the password
# has to be authenticated. If a user is changing her own password, we can do
# it by authenticating the old password and then changing to the new one. But
# if a user is changing someone else's password, there is currently no way
# to authenticate the user doing the changing, as her password is not stored
# anywhere. We could change this, but then we have the security implications of
# storing the plain-text password somewhere (such as in a session). So we just
# punt on the issue for now.
