Bric::Changes - Bricolage Changes

=head1 Description

This document lists the Changes to Bricolage introduced with each release.

=head1 Version 2.0.1 (2011-02-07)

=head2 Improvements

=over

=item *

Added C<SKIP_SSL_REDIRECT> F<bricolage.conf> directive. This directive
prevents Bricolage from redirecting to and from an SSL URL when C<SSL_ENABLE>
is turned on. The case for this is when Bricolage is running behind a reverse
proxy server that's handling SSL mappsings. Thanks to Alex Krohn for the
report. [David]

=item *

Added the "object" format for datetime values. Pass "object" as the formatting
string and a L<DateTime> object will be returned, rather than a string.
[David]

=item *

Refactored the SFTP mover to do proper error handling. Also removed the code
that "escapes" file names, as with more recent versions of Net::SSH2 it left
the backslashes in the file names. [David]

=item *

Bricolage now supports Apache 2 MPMs other than Prefork. YMMV (Bug #188).
[David]

=back

=head2 Bug Fixes

=over

=item *

Fixed a bug in the L<Bric::Util::ApacheReq> tests where they would fail if the
C<LISTEN_PORT> or C<SSL_PORT> F<bricolage.conf> directives were anything other
than 80 and 443, respectively. Thanks to Héctor Daniel Cortés González for the
report. [David]

=item *

The "Checkout" link no longer appears on desk items for users who do not have
permission to edit an asset [Kahil Jallad].

=item *

Fixed a bug where the SFTP mover would not properly finish moving the file,
leaving escaped tmp files on the destination server. [Matt Rolf]

=item *

Updating published stories or media or deployed templates via the SOAP
interface with the C<EXPIRE_ON_DEACTIVATE> F<bricolage.conf> directive enabled
no longer expires those assets unless they are active and the
C<< <expire_date> >> element is set in the XML. Thanks to Nick Legg for the
report (Bug # 184). [David]

=item *

Worked around a bug in L<Net::SSH2> where sockets weren't being closed,
leading to L<bric_queued> running out of file descriptors. [David]

=item *

The virtual FTP server no longer limits itself, but leaves resource limits to
the OS. This prevents apparently unrelated (and mysterious!) errors from the
FTP server. [Alex Krohn].

=item *

Fixed error message thrown by C<publish_another()> that incorrectly called
itself C<burn_another()>. [David]

=item *

When diffing documents and templates, if the "to" item is the current version,
the currently-checked out asset is used. This is so that one can see what
changes have been made since the checkout. Reported by Michael Herring.
[David]

=item *

Fixed bug in bric_ftpd where the ftp PWD command returns an incorrect path
(missing the site name).  Some ftp clients (eg. FileZilla) call PWD and use
this path after changing directories. [Adrian Yee]

=item *

Fixed a bug where desk asset counts would never be displayed regardless of the
preference setting (Bug #198). [Greg Heo]

=item *

The keyword autocomplete widget no longer suggests deleted keywords on the 
story and media profiles (Bug #206). [Greg Heo]

=item *

Fixed a bug where some valid date ranges would be rejected as invalid when
searching for assets. (Bug #211). [David Oliveira]

=back

=head1 Version 2.0.0 (2010-04-12)

=head2 Bug Fixes

=over

=item *

Fixed error handling in the access handler so that it works when a URI is a
directory. Thanks to Dave Rolsky for the initial patch. [David]

=item *

Updated session error handling to recognize a different error message in
recent versions of Apache::Session. [Dave Rolsky]

=item *

The buttons once again work in the category browser when the
C<ENABLE_CATEGORY_BROWSER> F<bricolage.conf> directive is true. Thanks to
Krzysztof Rudnik for the report (Bug #155). [David]

=item *

Fixed subtle category autocomplete issue where it can be difficult to choose
the root category. It would appear to work, but the "Unable to add category
that does not exist" message would not clear and the form would think that the
category isn't legal. Could apply to other categories, but was most common for
the root category. Thanks to Michael Herring for the detailed steps to
reproduce (Bug #157). [David]

=item *

Fixed bug where custom fields in the contributor profile did not appear in
some browsers. Thanks to Krzysztof Rudnik for the report (Bug #139). [David]

=item *

Fixed bug where publishing a story with multiple categories (and perhaps
multiple pages) led to the deletion of preivew files. Thanks to Guido
Buelskaemper for the report (Bug #156). [David]

=back

=head1 Version 1.11.4 (2010-03-29)

=head2 New Features

=over

=item *

Added the C<--match-title> option to F<contrib/bric_media_upload>. This will
match the uploading file name against the title of the media object rather than
the file name [Paul Orrock]

=item *

Added the new Bricolage logo to the user interface. [Phillip Smith]

=back

=head2 Improvements

=over

=item *

When displaying categories associated with a story and the
C<ENABLE_CATEGORY_BROWSER> F<bricolage.conf> directive is true, the categories
are now displayed in alphabetical order by URI. [David]

=item *

The installer no longer requires that L<Term::ReadPassword> be installed from
the CPAN before it continues. It will use it if it finds it, but if not it
substitutes a simple implementation that does the trick (Bug #136). [David]

=item *

When creating or editing a story or media document, the Source select list now
lists sources in alphabetical order. Reported by Michael Herring (Bug # 138).
[David]

=item *

Added the C<SFTP_KEY_TYPE>, C<SFTP_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE> and
C<SFTP_PUBLIC_KEY_FILE> F<bricolage.conf> directives to to restore key-based
authentication to the SFTP mover. These were necessary as the old F<SFTP_HOME>
directive does not work with the new implementation based on F<Net::SSH2> (Bug
# 127). [Greg Heo]


=item *

When started by the root user, the F<bric_queued> and F<bric_ftpd> daemons now
become the Bricolage system user (usually the Apache user) after forking their
subprocesses, rather than before. This means that the PID file is now created
by the root user, and so should encounter no permission errors when saving the
PID file to standard OS locations. Reported by Serge Ivanchenko. [David]

=item *

The default location for the FTP server's log files is now the F<log>
subdirectory of the bricolage root directory, rather than the bricolage root
directory itself. This is what comments in F<bricolage.conf> have always
suggested, even if L<Bric::Admin> and the code did not. [David]

=item *

Added the C<CATEGORY_MIN_CHARS> AND C<CATEGORY_MIN_CHARS_TMPL>
F<bricolage.conf> directives. These give administrators the ability to control
the responsiveness of the autosuggest box for selecting categories to
associate with documents and templates. It had been set to 2 to make it more
responsive to sites with very large numbers of categories, but most folks only
need it set to 1, which is now the default. [David]

=item *

Now require PostgreSQL 8.1 or higher. We will no longer support 8.0 or lower.
[David]

=item *

The contributor popup now submits the updated list of contributors to
Bricolage, which updates them in the document and returns the updated list of
contributors. That list then updates the contributors section of the document
profile. Thanks to this change, editing contributors twice in a document
without saving in between no longer causes the changes from the first edit to
be forgotten. It also allows any changes to the contributor order to in the
popup to be properly updated in the document profile. [David]

=item *

When hovering over the names of custom fields in the element type or
contributor type profile, the cursor displays as a "move" cursor, to indicate
that one can drag the field names in order to change their order. This
corresponds to the interface for reordering fields in documents. [David]

=item *

When creating new stories or media via the SOAP interface, Bricolage no longer
forces the publish status to be set to false, but sets it to true if the the
publish date is set or the publish status is true in the XML. In such cases,
it will also set the published version number to version 1. This is to make it
easier for one to migrate documents from one Bricolage instance to another
without having to edit the XML to set the publish status to a true value.
[David]

=back

=head2 Bug Fixes

=over

=item *

Fixed a regular expression typo that led to a test failure. [Greg Heo]

=item *

Adding a category to a story in a multi-site installation no longer has
a chance to throw a "Too many category objects found" error. [Greg Heo]

=item *

Moved document expiration on deletion from L<Bric::Biz::Asset> to
L<Bric::Biz::Asset::Business> because it's useless for templates and left
no-op job records lying around when templates were deleted. This code path
only executes when the C<EXPIRE_ON_DEACTIVATE> F<bricolage.conf> directive is
enabled. [David]

=item *

Fixed document expiration when the C<EXPIRE_ON_DEACTIVATE> F<bricolage.conf>
directive is enabled so that it doesn't try to expire documents that have
never been published, or media documents that have no URI associated with them.
Thanks to Aaron Fuleki and Denison University for the report. [David]

=item *

L<Bric::Util::Burner>'s C<publish()> method no longer removes documents from
workflow after publishing them, as such is the responsibility of the code that
calls publish. The publish callback already did, and now so does the
L<Bric::SOAP::Workflow> C<publish()> method. Thanks to David Beaudet for the
report and Aaron Fuleki for the steps to replicate (Bug #98). [David]

=item *

Fixed a bug where contributor and category search results would be propagated
to the contributor and category editing screens with a story or media
document. Searches from within documents should cache their own results,
separate from the admin search interfaces. [David]

=item *

Contributors associated with a story or media document and categories
associated with a story document are no longer paginated. When there were more
contributors or categories than would fit on a paginated page, the pagination
didn't work and reording didn't work. So by disabling pagination in this case,
we get around that issue. Documents with that many categories or contributors
are rare, so the trade-off seems worthwhile. Thanks to Bret Dawson for the
report (Bug #121). [David]

=item *

Fixed the "Log In" button so that the word "In" is antialiased. [Waldo
Jaquith]

=item *

New media can once again be created from a related media element. It was
broken by the switch to autocompleted category selection for new media
documents in 1.11.3. Thanks to Waldo Jaquith and Iván Chavero for the spot
(Bugs #134 and #135). [David]

=item *

Fixed the "Not a GLOB reference" error when using the PHP burner on Perl 5.10.
[Alex Krohn]

=item *

The simple search in workflows no longer disables navigation links on the same
horizontal line as the "Search" button. Thanks to Matt Rolf for the report
(Bug # 141) and to Marshall for the CSS jujitsu. [David]

=item *

The C<best_uri()> method of L<Bric::Util::Burner> now avoids expired stories
when searching for aliased stories. Thanks to Zdravko Balorda for the catch
(Bug #144). [David]

=item *

Fixed issue with the use of C<findElementsByClass()> when used with Prototype
1.6.0.3. Thanks to Adrian Yee for the report and suggested fix. [David]

=item *

Subelements can once again be added to media documents when the
C<ENABLE_CATEGORY_BROWSER> F<bricolage.conf> directive is enabled without
getting the error "Please select a primary category." Broken in 1.11.3. Thanks
to Vincent Stemen for the report (Bug #143). [David]

=item *

The field type profile now properly validates code select code and lets the
user know if it's not valid. [David]

=item *

The validation of code select field code is now consistent between the element
type profile, the field type profile, and the SOAP element type interface.
Thanks to Krzysztof Rudnik for the report (Bug #140). [David]

=item *

Media no longer throw the exception “Can't call method "write" on an undefined
value” when L<Imager> is doesn't recognize an image file format. Thanks to
Matt Rolf for the report (Bug #146). [David]

=item *

Deleting contributors in the contributor popup window now works the same as it
does when deleting them in the story or media profile: without a submit, but
by simply removing the contributor from the DOM. [David]

=item *

Hitting the "enter" key when searching for contributors in the contributor
popup no longer closes the window, but properly submits the search. Thanks to
Matt Rolf for the report (Bug #147).

=item *

Contributor type fields can once again be reordered and deleted. Thanks to
Krzysztof Rudnik for the report (Bug #139). [David]

=item *

When relating a story or media document, clicking a column header in the
search results in the related search popup no longer throws an error. Thanks
to Phillip for the report (Bug #149). [David]

=item *

The SOAP interface now sets the published version to the new version of a
story or media document that is being updated by XML that says the document is
published and where the published version was not previously set. [David]

=item *

When creating a template via the SOAP interface, if the template in the
specified output channel, category, and site already exists but is
deactivated, it will be re-activated and updated instead of throwing an error.
This matches how the UI works. [David]

=item *

Setting the C<RELATED_DOC_POD_TAG> F<bricolage.conf> directive to "url" no
longer breaks bulk edit. Thanks to Phillip for the report (Bug #150). [David]

=item *

The C<best_uri()> method of L<Bric::Util::Burner> now works when creating a
link to a story on a different site and the protocol for the output channel is
not set. It defaults to "http://" for the protocol. [David]

=back

=head1 Version 1.11.3 (2010-01-28)

=head2 Improvements

=over

=item *

The SFTP mover now respects a port specification in the host name (e.g,
"foo.example.com:22"), just like the FTP mover. Thanks to Iván Chavero for the
report and fix. [David]

=item *

The virtual FTP server now assumes that template files uploaded to it are
encoded in the user's preferred encoding. So if you have Windows gremlins in
your templates, you can set your "Character Set" preference to "CP1252" and it
will just work. Thanks to Phillip Smith for the report (L<Bug
#124|http://bricolage.lighthouseapp.com/projects/29601-bricolage/tickets/124>).
[David]

=item *

Added the C<--without-file> option to F<bric_soap> for use with the C<media
export> command. With this option, the resulting XML file will contain no
C<< <file> >> elements (which normally contain the Base64-encoded content of
the exported media documents). Also, when a media document is updated via
C<bric_soap media update>, if the XML file sent to the server contains no
C<< <file> >> elements, the existing file will be left alone, rather than
deleted. Suggested by Ashlee Caul. [David]

=item *

Added the "and Revert" or "and Delete" option to the "Check In" menu on
desk/My Workspace views. This saves the user from having to click "Edit" and
then "Cancel Checkout" to cancel a checkout. Suggested by Matt Rolf and
Phillip Smith. In order to make this happen, the code that handles canceling
a checkout, which was duplicated nearly verbatim in the callbacks for the
story, media, and template profiles has been factored out into a new class,
L<Bric::App::Callback::Util::Asset>. [David]

=item *

Removed the "Cancel Checkout" button from asset profiles, and added the "and
Revert" item to the "Check In" menu in its place. This change brings story,
media, and template profiles in line with the same option added to the "Check
In" menu on desks and My Workspace. [David]

=item *

Category selection when editing a media document or a template now uses an
autocomplete field rather than a select list, just like the story profile
does. [David]

=back

=head2 Bug Fixes

=item *

Cover dates are no longer exported from the SOAP API with the wrong year
(2009) when their dates are in the first three days of 2010. Thanks to Paul
Orrock for the spot (L<Bug
#122|http://bricolage.lighthouseapp.com/projects/29601-bricolage/tickets/122>)
and David Oliveira via Bret Dawson for the fix! [David]

=item *

Fixed an error in L<Bric::Biz::Contact> where a boolean value was not passed
to the database as a boolean. [David Oliveira]

=item *

Fixed an error in the way that IE7 handled errors thrown to a modal window
(L<Bug
#114|http://bricolage.lighthouseapp.com/projects/29601-bricolage/tickets/114>).
[Marshall]

=item *

Fixed encoding issue on MySQL. Thanks to Waldo Jaquith for the report. [David]

=item *

Destination distribution actions are editable again (L<Bug #
123|http://bricolage.lighthouseapp.com/projects/29601-bricolage/tickets/123>).
[David]

=item *

Fixed the F<favicon.ico> redirect so that it points to a full URL, not just a
URI path. [David]

=item *

Clicking the "Cancel" button in a server or action profile no longer redirects
to the login screen when the hostname to which the request is sent is
different than the hostname in F<httpd.conf>. This mainly effected development
and evaluation installs. Thanks to Adam Prime for identifying the solution
(disabling C<UseCanonicalName>). [David]

=item *

Fixed time zone compatibility issue on MySQL. Bricolage now sets C<time_zone>
at the same time it sets C<sql_mode>: when it connects to the database. This
ensures that date and time comparisons within the database are executed
correctly. It of course requires that time zones be installed in MySQL, which
can be done by running
C<mysql_tzinfo_to_sql /usr/share/zoneinfo | mysql -u root mysql>.

=back

=head1 Version 1.11.2 (2009-11-14)

=head2 New Features

=over

=item *

Added configuration directive to allow the expiration of assets when they are
deleted. [David, Mercier, Rolf and Herring]

=item *

Added the C<publishing()>, C<previewing()>, and C<compiling()> sugar methods
to L<Bric::Util::Burner|Bric::Util::Burner> because I'm sick of seeing the
same code to check modes in templates all the time. [David]

=item *

Take keyword permissions into account when accessing or creating keywords from
the story and media profiles as well as category manager. [Adrian Yee]

=item *

Added support for copying and pasting elements in the story profile.
[Adrian Yee]

=item *

Added the C<find_or_create_alternate()> method to
L<Bric::Biz::Asset::Business::Media|Bric::Biz::Asset::Business::Media> class.
This method makes it easy for templates to create alternate representations of
an image as a new media document. Useful for generating thumbnails and the 
like. As a side-effect, L<Imager|Imager> is now a required module. [David]

=item *

Since L<Imager|Imager> is now a required module, the C<USE_THUMBNAILS>
directive is now enabled by default as well. [David]

=item *

Added the following aliases, so I can pretend that the versions with double
underscores don't exist:

=over

=item C<Bric::Biz::Asset::Business::set_source_id()>

=item C<Bric::Biz::Asset::Business::get_source_id()>

=item C<Bric::Biz::Asset::get_user_id()>

=item C<Bric::Biz::Asset::Business::Media::get_category_id()>

=back

[David]

=back

=head2 Improvements

=over

=item *

Added the C<is_republish> and C<is_first_publish> methods to
L<Bric::Util::Burner|Bric::Util::Burner>. [David]

=item *

The CPAN module installer now relies on L<CPAN|CPAN> to determine if a module
was successfully installed and is the proper version number, rather than doing
that work itself. This addresses an issue when installing mod_perl modules,
which would be installed properly but the installer would think that they
weren't. [David]

=item *

Changed autocomplete category selection for stories so that if you have the
C<FULL_SEARCH> config directive turned on, you get wildcard matching to any
part of the URI on your entered string, so typing "bar" will return "/bar" and
"/foo/bart". Enter "/" for a full list of categories. [Paul Orrock]

=item *

Added text beneath all buttons for desk items to make them more intuitive.
[Sarah Mercier, Matt Rolf and Michael Herring]

=item *

Added more translations in German and Russian. [Alisa Gdalina]

=item *

Made "Delete this Profile" text more specific depending on location, such as
"Delete this Story" or "Delete this Element Type", etc.
[Sarah Mercier and Matt Rolf]

=item *

Switched to passing parameters for Net::SSH2 authentication in
L<Bric::Util::Trans::SFTP|Bric::Util::Trans::SFTP> so that it will first try
C<auth_password>, and then follow up with C<auth_keyboard> should the first
fail (and will also try SSH keys if you happen to have that configured). [Alex
Krohn]

=item *

Upgraded Prototype and Scriptaculous libraries to versions 1.6.0.3 and 1.8.2
respectively. [Rolf, Mercier, Herring]

=item *

Display a hint about subelements in the story view. This is especially
important when they have no related stories or media and are not revealed, so
that you can tell what each is! [David & Adrian Yee]

=item *

Workspaces, Desks, and debug messages validate again. [Matt Rolf]

=item *

Dragging container elements to the edge of the browser window will now
scroll the page. Reported by Matt Rolf. [Sarah Mercier]

=item *

Factored the creation of a canonical URL for a request into a new method,
C<< Bric::Util::ApacheReq->url >>. This removes a fair bit of duplicate code
found here and there. [David]

=item *

Cover date is now required at the database level. It has always been required
in the UI. [David]

=item *

Calls to C<log_event()> are immediately logged when not running under
C<mod_perl> or F<bric_queued>. This is so that events will now always be
properly logged. [David]

=item *

Made the thumbnail format-guesser case-insensitive (e.g. F<.JPG> or F<.PDF>
will also work now). [Scott]

=item *

Made the popup dialog for related stories/media a bit bigger. [Scott]

=item *

Added a throbber to category completion in New Story screen and the Story
Profile. [Scott]

=item *

Added the "Bricolage events feed generator" (F<contrib/bric_events_rss>)
contrib application. Generates RSS output for all system events. [Greg Heo]

=item *

Renamed F<Makefile> to F<Makefile.in> and changed C<Makefile.PL> so that it
creates F<Makefile> from F<Makefile.in>. This is so that F<Makefile> is no
longer changed in-place, which could get annoying when doing development.
[David]

=item *

Added C<mark_as_published()> method to
L<Bric::Biz::Asset::Business|Bric::Biz::Asset::Business>. This method marks a
document as published but does not create jobs or resources and no templates
will be executed. [Paul Orrock]

=item *

Added the C<timeout> attribute to L<Bric::Dist::Client|Bric::Dist::Client> and
the corresponding C<-t> option to L<bric_dist_mon|bric_dist_mon>. [David]

=item *

Added the C<sql_type> element to the export of field types from SOAP. This
prevents the SOAP server from having to guess the SQL type of a field type
when updating an element type. Thanks to David Oliveira for the report (Bug
#79). [David]

=item *

Added a timestamp for data that F<bric_queued> sends to its log. Thanks to Neal
Sofge for the suggestion (Bug #41). [David]

=item *

Renamed the "Lock Val" checkbox in the media profile to "Autopopulate". It is
now checked by default, rather than unchecked. Uncheck it to prevent Bricolage
from autopopulating values in the future. Thanks to Marshall for the
suggestion (Bug #32). [David]

=item *

Changed "Click here to start" to "Start Bricolage" on the welcome page.
Suggested by Chris Heiland and Czerny (Bug #42). [David]

=item *

When an asset drops off a desk or My Workspace (because it is checked in or
moved to a different desk), and it's the last asset of its type (story, media,
or template), the asset type label and sort menu will also drop off the desk
or workspace. Thanks to Matt Rolf for the suggestion (Bug #69). [David]

=item *

Moved the "Cancel" and "Save" buttons in the contributor popup up from the
bottom of the screen (it was below search results) to under the list of
contributors currently associated with the story and above the search box.
This makes it much easier to find the buttons when there are a lot of search
results. Thanks to Scott for the report (Bug #84). [David]

=back

=head2 Bug Fixes

=item *

Fixed a bug in the loading of WYSIWYG editor callback code in the Apache
configuration. [John Durkin]

=item *

Uploading a media file to a related media element to create a new media
document now Works properly when the related media element is a subelement.
Reported by John Durkin (Bug #1364). [David]

=item *

Fixed a bug where an attempt to export a story via SOAP failed due to a bad
method call. Reported by Denny de la Haye. [David]

=item *

Added a JavaScript call to confirm a delete action on Workspace and desk.
Reported by Matt Rolf (Bug 1380). [Sarah Mercier]

=item *

Fixed problem with rendering of radio button fields (Bug #1387).
[Denny de la Haye]

=item *

Fixed L<Bric> to load L<Bric::Config> before anything else, which was causing
problems on some systems. [Paul Orrock]

=item *

Fixed problem with L<Bric::SOAP> so that the first field or container is
correctly numbered at 0 rather than 2. [Paul Orrock]

=item *

Fix bug where a story imported through L<Bric::SOAP> didn't have its
C<object_order> set properly so wouldn't preview through templates until saved
in the UI (Bug # 1394 && Bug # 1397). [Paul Orrock]

=item *

Fixed up broken/non-compliant HTML on desks, search results and workspace.
[Paul Orrock]

=item *

Improved the appearance of popup menuson desks. [Sarah Mercier and Matt Rolf]

=item *

In the story profile, the primary category now shows as a required field (Bug
#1400). [Matt Rolf]

=item *

Re-labeled the Associations box the story and template profile (Bug #1414).
[Matt Rolf]

=item *

Fixed the C<get_uri()> method of
L<Bric::Biz::Asset::Business::Media|Bric::Biz::Asset::Business::Media> so that
it URI escapes the media file name. [David]

=item *

Fixed bug when uploading a new media file to a related media element so that,
when running under mod_perl 1, headers are properly sent I<before> the content
is sent. This should fix some of the issues with the related media popup
window. [Adrian Yee]

=item *

The Add Element dropdown menu will now close on double click (Bug #1405).
[Sarah Mercier and Matt Rolf]

=item *

The find stories/media/template advanced search toggle now works properly.
(Bug #1426) [Sarah Mercier and Matt Rolf]

=item *

Fixed bug where IE7 couldn't open the sidenav. [Kahil Jallad]

=item *

Fixed bug where removing a subelement or custom field from an element type
would result in an error when editing a story with one of those elements.
[Bret Dawson]

=item *

Fixed typing error which caused the upgrade script to fail. [Darren Embry]

=item *

Deleting keywords from a category no longer causes an error. [Adrian Yee]

=item *

Fixed bug where new bulk edit button would cause submit error in IE7 because
it didn't call the C<customSubmit()> JavaScript function. [Kahil Jallad, Sarah
Mercier]

=item *

Hitting the enter key now properly submits a search in the advanced search
form (Bug #1425). [Bret Dawson]

=item *

Desks no longer have double pagination bars at the bottom (Bug #1439). [Matt
Rolf]

=item *

Fixed a bug where deleting a checked out asset from My Workspace or the desk
would still offer an Edit link in the search results. Reported by John Durkin
and Matt Rolf (Bug #1388). [Greg Heo]

=item *

Fixed bug in C<inst/required.pl> so it remembers what you're trying to install
when telling you what's missing. Also added documentation to
C<inst/htprobe_apache2.pl> about not finding the C<apreq> module. [Paul
Orrock]

=item *

The help button no longer wipes unsaved values from pages when clicked (Bug
#1386). [Sarah Mercier]

=item *

Added a check to C<inst/required.pl> to check for a preforking Apache 2 rather
than a threaded worker Apache 2. [Paul Orrock]

It was possible in the New Story screen, despite autocompletion, to enter a

Response error handling in L<Bric::Dist::Client|Bric::Dist::Client>, which is

Thanks to Scott Lanning for the spot, and Aaron Fuleki for the kick to get it
fixed (Bug #82 / #1456). [David]

=item *

Fixed compatibility issues on MySQL. Bricolage now sets C<sql_mode> when it
connects to the database, so that MySQL itself does not have to globally set
that option, as it could cause conflicts with other apps running on MySQL.
Also removed the attempt to set C<sql_mode> globally at installation time; it

The category autocompletion feature in the "New Story" profile now refuses to

Double-clicking an asset on a desk to check it into that desk no longer causes

Net::SFTP. [Sarah Mercier, Matt Rolf, Charlie Reitsma, Michael Herring]

=item *

The C<to_preview> option to C<< Bric::SOAP::Workflow->publish >> now previews
a document for all output channels, not just the primary output channel. The
same of course applies to the C<--to-preview> option to F<bric_soap>.
Suggested by Terence Bodola. [David]

=item *

Server errors sent in response to Ajax requests are now displayed in a modal
lightbox widget, rather than just getting shoved into the DOM. Also, effects
that should only occur on success (such as removing a story from a desk when
you move it) now only happen on success. [David]

=item *

Changed the behavior of C<< Bric::Util::Burner->publish_another >> so that,
rather than immediately publishing a document, it instead adds it to a list of
documents to be published and then returns. Documents added to the list are
then published when all other publish jobs in a given request have finished
publishing. The upshot is that if you bulk publish 50 stories that all trigger
the republication of a home page story, that home page story will be
republished only once, rather than 50 times. A side-effect is memory
consumption, so don't send too many stories to C<publish_another> from your
templates! Sponsored by NetStumbler and Kineticode, with production testing by
the National Gallery of Art. [David]

=item *

Removed the "Related Story" and "Related Media" sections of the element
profile, as they are now included in the "Content" sections of the element
profile, and therefore redundant. [David]

=item *

The upload field for related media (available when the C<RELATED_MEDIA_UPLOAD>
F<bricolage.conf> directive is enabled) is no longer displayed in the element
profile. Instead, it is displayed in the "Edit" popup window, where you can
now search for an existing media document I<or> upload a new file. This
eliminates a bug when more than one upload field was displayed in the
"Content" section of a document profile. It also makes it clearer that you're
editing a new, related media document, as the popup looks different than the
main display window (in that it has no navigation bar). [David]

=item *

Permission and conflict messages thrown by callbacks in response to Ajax
requests now cause a lightbox to be thrown up with the message highlighted.
This means, for example, that if a user tries to move a story they don't have
permission to move, the story will not appear to be moved in the UI and the
user will be told that she lacks the permission. [David]

=item *

The "New Story" page now uses an autocomplete field to select a primary
category. [David]

=item *

Minor improvements to the dynamic display and handling of container elements
in document profiles. [David]

=item *

Related media and/or story subelements may now be toggled to show/hide them
like any other subelements in a document. [David]

=item *

Added the "displayed" attribute to element type and container objects. Setting
it on a subelement type causes the value to be set on new containers based on
that type. [David]

=item *

Container elements in the document profile are now toggled open or closed
depending on their "displayed" attribute, which persists across saves and
versions. This means that the appearence of a document is the same as you left
it, or as the user who last checked it in left it. [David]

=item *

New container elements added in the document profile now cause the containing
element to always be toggled open, and the newly added container is also
toggled open. [David]

=item *

The installer now explicitly sets permissions on the files it installs, rather
than using the same permissions as the files have in the distribution. This is
because a umask could force the unpacked distribution files to have
permissions that are inappropriate for installed files. Reported by Roland van
Ipenburg (Bug #1360). [David]

=item *

The installer now sets the permissions on configuration files to `0640`,
rather than `0644`, as before, so that the files are no longer world-readable
on the system. [David]

=item *

`make upgrade` is now better at determining the installed configuration,
rather than making you select the database server and version of Apache again,
it properly remembers the already-intalled configuration. [David]

Fixed non-standard installation path being ignored if changed during "multi"

others are then evaled they get changed too. [Paul Orrock]

=item *

Updated L<Bric::Admin|Bric::Admin> to ensure that we have at least version

Added a C<NONE> function to L<Bric::Util::DBI|Bric::Util::DBI>. For any
C<list> parameter where you could've used C<ANY> before, you can now also use
C<NONE> to return only objects that I<don't> match. [Scott]

Added support for Apache 2. See L<Switching to Apache 2 in
Bric::Admin|Bric::Admin/"Switching to Apache 2"> or in F<README> for details
on switching an existing Bricolage installation from Apache 1 to Apache 2.
[Scott, Chris Heiland, David]

=item *

Added element occurrence specification, from Christian Muise's 2006 Google
Summer of Code project. Element types and field types can now have required
minimum and maximum numbers of times they appear in a document. For example,
if a "pull quote" element type has a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 4, when a
new story is created it will be pre-populated with 2 pull quote elements. The
user can add up to two more, but no more. If either min or max are 0, then
there is no minimum or maximum. For backwards compatibility, the upgrade will
set existing element types and field types to have min and max set to 0.

=head2 UI Improvements

=over

=item *

JavaScript is now being used more extensively throughout the UI to improve
performance and usability.

=over

=item *

The following items can now be edited on-the-fly (i.e. without reloading):

=over

=item * Fields and subelements in the story and media profiles

=item * Keywords in the story, media, and category profiles

=item * Categories in the story profile

=item * Output Channels in the story and media profiles

=item * Organizations in the source profile

=item * Roles in the contributor profile

=item * Contacts in the user and contributor profiles

=item * Extensions in the media type profile

=item * Rules in the alert type profile

=back

=item *

Fields and subelements in the story and media profiles are displayed in full,
so a story's entire contents can be edited from one screen, as opposed to one
screen per subelement as it was previously.

=item *

The right side of desk items has been redesigned. Icons are used because they
save space, and they finally allow assets to be moved between desks from the
Workspace, and assets to be checked in to any desk from the Desk view. The
"and Publish" and "and Shelve" options have also been added. Additionally, you
have the option to immediately publish assets on publish desks, or schedule
them for later.

=item *

Desks now use JavaScript to execute actions immediately. Where you previously
had to choose an action from a select list and scroll all the way to the
bottom to execute it, you can now check in, move, check out, or delete an asset
in one click, without a full page refresh.

=item *

The event log and trail have been merged and improved. The trail was a subset
of the event log that only showed desk moves. You can now filter the log by
any event type, and there's a dedicated link to choose the right event types
to recreate the trail.

=item *

Error details (including oft-requested stack traces) are now viewable directly
from the 500 error page, instead of having to check the F<error_log> or view
the error page's source. To avoid scaring lay people, the details are only
shown (via JavaScript) when the new "View Error Details" link is clicked.

=item *

When more than 3 error messages need to be displayed, the first three are
shown, along with a (more) link, which expands to show the remaining messages.

They're documented in
L<Bric::Admin|Bric::Admin/"Installation Variables">/F<INSTALL>, and are most
useful when used in combination with either C<INSTALL_VERBOSITY=QUIET> or
C<make dev>. [David]

=item *

The installer is no longer required to become the system super user (root)
during C<make install>, although it is still recommended. During the database
configuration, the installer asks whether it should create the database and if
it should become the database system user during installation, which is the
bit that required the user to be root, and is required for compatibility with
"ident" authentication. The default is to not become the database system user,
although C<make install> may still need to be run as the super user in order
to install files in their proper locations. [Brian Smith and David]

When editing a field type, if a numeric value is set to an empty value, it

L<Bric::Util::Burner>'s C<publish()> method no longer removes documents from
workflow after publishing them, as such is the responsbility of the code that
calls publish. The publish callback already did, and now so does the
L<Bric::SOAP::Workflow> C<publish()> method. Thanks to David Beaudet for the
report and Aaron Fuleki for the steps to replicate (Bug #98). [David]

=item *

Fixed a bug where contributor and category search results would be propagated
to the contributor and category editing screens with a story or media
document. Searches from within documents should cache their own results,
separate from the admin search interfaces. [David]

=item *

Contributors associated with a story or media document and categories
associated with a story document are no longer paginated. When there were more
contributors or categories than would fit on a paginated page, the pagination
didn't work and reording didn't work. So by disabling pagination in this case,
we get around that issue. Documents with that many categories or contributors
are rare, so the trade-off seems worthwhile. Thanks to Bret Dawson for the
report (Bug #121). [David]

=item *

When associating a contributor with a media document, don't prompt for role
selection if the contributor has only one role. This saves a page load for
each contributor association and brings media in line with how story
contributor association already works. [David]

The C<AddModule> lines are now commented-out in the F<httpd.conf> generated by

the error message, is to pass C<< published_version => 1 >> when looking for
documents to publish from within templates. [David]

Fixed a bug where authorization failures in callbacks could lead to a bogus
error, rather than sending a "Permission Denied" error to the user. Reported
by Matt Rolf (Bug #1362). [David]

=item *

Fixed a div nesting bug which was causing buttons to improperly align
depending on pagination choices. [Matt Rolf]

=item *

Fixed a typo in F<bric_soap> that prevented it from compiling. Reported by
Ashlee Caul. [David]

=item *

Fixed a bug where a publish would appear to fail when no publish jobs were
created (for example, when a story is published to a destination with no
associated servers). Reported by Ashlee Caul. [David]

=item *

Fixed a bug where the media type of an uploaded file would not be detected if
its extension had upper-case characters. Reported by Bret Dawson. [Greg Heo]

=item *

Changed the SOAP checkin code so that it is functinally identical to the UI
checkin code. Hoping that this solves the issue with duplicate version
constraint violations. [David]

=item *

Looking up a document or template by version ID no longer fails if the asset
has been checked out and not yet checked back in since that version ID was
created. Among other subtle bugs, this change fixes publishes that failed with
the error message 'Can't call method "get_id" on an undefined value'. Reported
by Scott (Bug #1417). [David]

Fixed a bug where a scheduled publish can muck with version numbers. Reported

Fixed a bug with the virtual FTP server where deploying a template by renaming
it with ".deploy" at the end can cause the template to be stranded on a desk.
Reported by Phillip Smith (Bug # 1372). [David]

Fixed resource (file name) lookups when publishing and/or previewing documents
so that SQL C<LIKE> wildcard characters are ignored, so as to avoid confusing,
for example, C</foo/bar> with C</foo_bar>. Reported by Scott (Bug # 1368).

Republishing a story will no longer delete files from that story on preview
servers. Similarly, publishing a media document with a new file but with the same
name as a previously-published version will no longer cause that file to be
deleted from production destinations. This bug has been fixed and refixed
numerous times, but this time tests have been added to make sure that it
I<stays> fixed. Reported by Matt Rolf, Ashlee Caul, and others (Bug # 1368).

The "Logged in as" link at the top of every screen now properly uses SSL when
appropriate. [David]

=item *

Fixed an inconsistency in how the case of file names in media documents was
not always properly set according to the rules for the output channel. This
means that if your media document's output channel requires lowercase URIs,
the URI for the media document will always be lowercase, including the file
name. The file name is also now always consistently URI escaped (Bug #1419).

Tweaked F<contrib/bric_media_upload/bric_media_upload> so that it uses
C<bric_soap site list_ids> instead of C<bric_soap category list_ids> for setting

When the "Filter by Site Context" preference is turned on, if a user does a

to the new site until the user submits a new search. Reported by Matt Rolf
(Bug #1337). [David]

=item *

Rewrote (again) the way in which stale files are identified for expiration. It
used to be that Bricolage would look for all resources associated with a given
document and output channel but none of the current jobs. But if a story had
previously been in two output channels and one was removed, Bricolage didn't
look for stale files in that output channel. So now Bricolage asks for a list
of resources associated with a document but none of the jobs created in a
publish, and then expires them all, regardless of URI, output channel, or file
system path. This should fix the expiration of stale files once and for all
(Bug #1351). [David]

The links to jump to different kinds of assets on My Workspace (or a desk if

The C<get_related_objects()> method of
L<Bric::Biz::Asset::Business|Bric::Biz::Asset::Business> now only returns
relateds for an alias that are in the same site as the alias, or that are
aliases in the same site of the original relateds. This means that the
automatic publishing of related documents should now properly republish only
relateds in the same site as the alias document being published, rather than
the relateds of the document it aliases (Bug # 1296). [David]

=item *

In the New Story form, the "Slug" field is no longer required if the
C<ALLOW_SLUGLESS_NONFIXED> F<bricolage.conf> directive is disabled and the

Object attributes that are edited in textarea fields in the UI and that have a
limited size -- mainly "description" fields -- now have their line endings

Bricolage no longer throws an exception when Imager fails to open an image

"Save" or the "Save and Stay" button is pressed. Reported by Chris Schults
(Ticket #1240). [David]

=item *

Searches by URI for media to relate to a document now properly
remember the search results the next time the related media search page is
loaded. Reported by Chris Schults (Ticket # 1241). [David]

=item *

`make dev` no longer supports the "single" installation mode, since it

Bricolage now assumes that template files uploaded in the template profile are
encoded in UTF-8, since the same is assumed for templates pasted into the form

Fixed resource deletion code in L<Bric::DBA|Bric::DBA> to properly use
booleans for boolean columns. Reported by John Greene. [David]

Internationalized the JavaScript messages for the Find/Replace dialog box,
although there are currently no translations. [David]

Optimized the C<get_notes()> and C<has_notes()> methods of
L<Bric::Biz::Asset|Bric::Biz::Asset> and therefore of the story, media, and

=item *

Object select lists (such as for story element types when creating a new
story) will now display as scrolling lists if there are more than 50 items in
the list, rather than 20 or more items. [David]

=item *

Added a CSS ID to the C<< <body> >> tag in the UI, of the form
"bricolage_C<VHOST_SERVER_NAME>", where C<VHOST_SERVER_NAME> is the value
defined in F<bricolage.conf>.  Use this ID when writing user stylesheets

When a story is previewed, any related media are distributed to the preview
server only if the C<AUTO_PREVIEW_MEDIA> F<bricolage.conf> directive is
disabled or the media documents need to be previewed. [David]

=item *

Added installation defaults for FreeBSD that will be used when the
C<USE_DEFAULTS> environment variable is set to "freebsd" during installation.
[Rod Taylor]

=item *

Added a C<make devclone> option which does the same as C<make clone> but
removes all of the locally previewed files, the F<data/obj> files, staging and
sandboxes. This means a large saving in download size for cloned production
systems. [Paul Orrock]

=item *

Added C<ALLOW_URIS_WITHOUT_CATEGORIES> F<bricolage.conf> directive to allow
URI formats not to include "%{categories}", which is otherwise rquired. Use
this directive with caution since it is not the recommended behaviour. [Paul
Orrock]

=item *

Added a tooltip to show the underlying Bricolage database ID when hovering
over a UUID in a story profile. This feature complements showing the UUID when
the hovering over the Bricolage ID in a desk view. [Paul Orrock]

=item *

Changed the database columns for the C<name>, C<key_name>, and C<description>
attributes of
L<Bric::Biz::ElementType::Parts::FieldType|Bric::Biz::ElementType::Parts::FieldType>
from C<VARCHAR> to C<TEXT>, since some folks will have field types with names
and key names longer than 32 characters. Reported by Nate Perry-Thistle.
[David]

=item *

Created two new make targets, "install_files" and "install_db", to allow the
files to be installed without doing anything with the database. Useful for
packagers who need to let users manually create the database. [Marshall]

Fixed localization errors such as, "Can't use "for Published" as a method name
in bracket group," which appeared in searches and on desks. Thanks to Guido
Bülskämper for the spot! [David]

=item *

The database upgrade script now updates table permissions after executing all
of the scripts for each version to be upgraded, rather than after all of the
upgrade scripts have run, thus allowing later scripts to properly access
tables created by earlier scripts. Reported by Nate Perry-Thistle. [David]

=item *

Fixed some of the 1.8.9 upgrade scripts that run I<after> the 1.9.x upgrade
scripts to that they are properly compatible. [Nate Perry-Thistle, Rod Taylor,

=item *

L<Bric::Biz::ElementType|Bric::Biz::ElementType> loads again. [Nate
Perry-Thistle]

=item *

The C<MEDIA_UNIQUE_FILENAME> F<bricolage.conf> directive is now fixed so that
the file name creation comes after the ID generation and therefore correctly
saves the renamed file. [Paul Orrock]

=item *

Fixed the UI display in Firefox and IE. Particularly Meta Assets displaying
down the page in IE, stretching out the banner in desks, corrected side menu
position in IE and removed reference to broken images left in from the CSS
reworking. Also fixed textarea which was ignoring cols setting in IE and set
textarea col width for bulk edit to 80 wide, rather than 30 (although it
should expand with the window size in most browsers). [Paul Orrock]

=item *

Fixed the history so that clicking the return button in the UI no longer goes
back to the preview page when the preview page was the last page accessed.
[Paul Orrock]

=item *

The XML generated when exporting element types via SOAP no longer includes
the C<top_level> element twice, thus avoiding mysterious "no sites defined"
errors when attempting to import or update element types from that XML.
Reported by Nate Perry-Thistle. [David]

=item *

Reverting stories and media no longer leads to occasional errors such as,
"Too many Bric::Biz::Element::Container objects found". Reported by Simon
Wilcox. [David]

Disabled the "sticky" scroll bar in the story profile. It just didn't work
very well. [David]

The "Allow Multiple" checkbox and "Size" field in the "Add New Field" section
of the element type profile work again. Reported by Rod Taylor and Paul

Multiple select lists no longer break the story and element profiles, and can
once again have their values properly changed from multiple to single to none.
Spotted by Rod Taylor. [David]

=item *

Desk pagination is now properly styled. [David]

=item *

Assets can once again be properly deleted from desks. [David]

=item *

Silenced status messages when previewing a media document under the
C<AUTO_PREVIEW_MEDIA> F<bricolage.conf> directive. Reported by Rod Taylor.
[David]

=item *

Cancelling the checkout of an media document now deletes any new file that has
been uploaded and, if the C<AUTO_PREVIEW_MEDIA> F<bricolage.conf> directive is
enabled, re-previews the previous version of the media file. [David]

=item *

The autopopulated fields for image element types are now created when a new
image element type is created. This was made possible by moving the selection
of media type (Image, Audio, Video, or Other Media) to the New Element Type
screen, where it is now part of the "Content Type" select list, which also
includes the Story and Subelement options. As a result, one can no longer
change the media type in an existing element type (not that it ever made sense
to do so). Reported by Paul Orrock. [David]

=item *

Fixed the selection of text triggered by the Find dialog box on Mozilla and IE
(although I find IE to be a bit broken in this way). [David]

=item *

Fixed the size of the preview links on desks/My workspace. [David]

=item *

Failed jobs can once again be cancelled. Reported by Rod Taylor. [David]

=item *

Publishing multiple versions of a document before any of the publish jobs for
those versions are executed no longer leads to publishing errors when the
older version is published. Thanks to Rod Taylor for the spot! [David]

=item *

The element trace generated for burn errors (those created by
C<< $burner->throw_error() >>) now use the C<place> attribute of the element
where the error was thrown, rather than the C<object_order>, since C<place>
corresponds to the "Position" select list orderings in the UI, and therefore
makes it much simpler to figure out where the error is. [David]

=item *

Output channels with includes can now be created via the output channel SOAP
interface. [David]

=item *

Fixed the category SOAP interface to support post-1.10 URIs that support paths
ending in a slash. [David]

Fixed the publication of multiple documents at once from a publish desk so
that documents that are both selected and related to other documents don't get
skipped. [David]

The "Find Templates" results now display the template URI rather than its file
name, to be consistent with the template profile. Reported by Marshall.

Eliminated letter graphics for "Published" and "Deployed" labels in story,
media, and template managers in favor of localizable characters. [David]

=item *

Moved the C<display_pages()> method from subclasses to
L<Bric::Util::Burner|Bric::Util::Burner>. Each subclass must implement a
C<display_element()> method for it to work; this means that it works for all
current burners except the HTML::Template burner, which manages pages
differently. This also fixed pagination issues in the Template Toolkit and PHP
burners. [David]

=item *

Completely updated L<Bric::Templates|Bric::Templates> and
L<Bric::AdvTemplates|Bric::AdvTemplates>, with expanded API documentation and
examples in Mason, Template Toolkit, and PHP. [David]

=item *

Refactored the left navigation code to perform better and be easier to
maintain. It now also sorts the admin menu items in alphabetical order by the
localized name of each. [David]

=item *

Updated the UI to fix Internet Explorer glitches. [Marshall]

=item *

The Element Type profile is now much smarter about displaying site
associations with an element type. If the user has access to only one site and
the element type is associated with no more than one site, then the "Sites"
section won't be displayed, but the primary output channel can be selected via
a radio button among the list of output channels. If the user has access to
more than one site or if the element type is associated with more than one
site, the "Sites" section will be displayed and the primary output channel can
be selected from a select list for each site. [David]

=item *

The Element Type Manager now displays the key name for each element, in
addition to its name, and instead of the its description. [David]

=item *

Added C<RELATED_DOC_POD_TAG> F<bricolage.conf> directive, so that users don't
have to be limited to seeing related stories and related media represented by
C<=related_story_uuid> and C<=related_media_uuid>. Just set it to "uuid",
"uri", "url", or "id" to get a different tag. [David]

=item *

Optimized comparison of new and old attribute values when setting attributes.
Based on an example sent by Curtis "Ovid" Poe. [David]

=item *

Added C<site> parameter for a site name to the list() methods of the story,
media, and template classes. [David]

Added F<republish_by_uri> contrib script. [David and Mark]

=item *

Field types can now have their widgets changed via the UI as well as via SOAP.
So you can change a "text" widget to "textarea", for example. [David]

Added C<serialize_to_pod()> and C<update_from_pod()> methods to the container
element class. These support a pseudo-pod syntax that enables a complete
hierarchy of elements to be edited, including links to related stories and
media, in a single stream of text. [David]

=item *

Converted "Bulk Edit" in the UI to use the new POD syntax supported by the
element classes and eliminated the old "Super Bulk Edit" interface since it
became redundant. [David]

=item *

Added the "Include deleted" checkbox to Advanced Search in "Find Stories,"
"Find Media," and "Find Templates" intefaces; this allows searching for and
reactivating deleted stories, media, and templates. [Scott]

=item *

Added the "Subelement" select list to the "Find Stories" interface, to allow
searching on stories by the types of subelements they contain. [Scott]

=item *

The C<Order> and C<OrderDirection> parameters to the C<list()> methods of the
story, media, and template classes can now be specified as array references so
as to sort on more than one attribute. [David]

=item *

Added C<Order>, C<OrderDirection>, C<Limit>, and C<Offset> parameters to the
C<list()> method of Bric::Util::Event. [David]

=item *

Added diff support to the UI to see changes between versions of templates,
stories, and media documents. [David]

=item *

Added JavaScript-powered Find/Replace dialog box to Bulk Edit in the element
profile and to the template profile. The "Replace All" function should work
very well everywhere, while the "Find" function relies on IE- and
Mozilla-specific features to properly highlight found text in the textarea box
searched. Other browsers will get an alert indicating at what character the
match was found. [David]

=item *

Added new "Code Select" custom field allows you to add arbitrary Perl code to
generate the items in a select list. This is great for dynamically pulling in
choices from another database, LDAP directory, or anything else you can get at
from Perl code. [Scott]

=item *

Added ability to shelve a story from a desk or My Workspace. [David]

=item *

Added C<reset()> method to L<Bric::Util::Job|Bric::Util::Job> and a "Reset"
checkbox in the job profile in the UI so that failed jobs can easily be
re-attempted. [David]

Added "Cheat Sheet" dialog box to Bulk Edit that displays the entire hierarchy

Added C<related_story_id> and C<related_media_id> parameters to the C<list()>
method of the story and media classes to search for stories and media that
have a given story or media ID or list of IDs as relateds. Based on a patch
from Rod Taylor. [David]

=item *

Moved story, media, and template notes into a column in the appropriate
instance table, instead using attributes, and then removed the story, media,
and template attribute objects. This is a much more efficient use of the
database and eliminates a lot of cruft. [David]

=item *

Added C<has_notes()> method to L<Bric::Biz::Asset|Bric::Biz::Asset> (and
therefore its story, media, and template subclasses) as a more efficient way
of determining whether an asset has notes for any of its versions than calling
the C<get_notes()> method. [David]

=item *

Added C<note> parameter to the C<list()> method of the story, media, and
template classes. Unlike most of the parameters, this one will return assets
with C<any> of their versions having a note matching the C<note> parameter.
[David]

=item *

Updated search documentation and wrote tests for:

=over

=item L<Bric::Dist::ActionType|Bric::Dist::ActionType>

=item L<Bric::Util::Alert|Bric::Util::Alert>

=item L<Bric::Util::Alerted|Bric::Util::Alerted>

[David]

=item *

The new "Repreview" iframe now works for the links in subelements, too.
[David]

=item *

Category and story URIs now all end in a slash. This is so that they all
behave consistently with root categories and home page URIs, and so that they
properly indicate directories. Note that this does not apply if the
C<STORY_URI_WITH_FILENAME> F<bricolage.conf> directive has been enabled.
B<Note to Templaters:> You may need to modify your templates to take into
account that story and category URIS now end in a slash, if you were appending
a slash in your templates or searching on category URIs for related stories.
[David]

=item *

Now require Perl 5.8.0 or newer. Realistically it should only be 5.8.3 or
newer. [David]

=item *

Added support for searching on UUIDs to the story and media classes. [David]

=item *

Added support for searching on URIs in the story class and modified the same
parameter in the media class to search I<all> possible URIs for media, not
just the URI associated with the primary output channel. [David]

=item *

The select list of fields and subelements that can be added to an element now
lists all of the fields and subelements in alphabetical order. [David]

=item *

Improved JavaScript word and character counts in Bulk Edit so that they're
actually accurate, including when POD tags are present. [David]

=item *

The word and character counts in Bulk Edit are now kept up-to-date as you
type. [David]

=item *

Added the current element object to exception object in C<throw_burn_error>
and, by extension the burner C<throw_error()> method. Now a kind of breadcrumb
trail will illustrate where in the element hierarchy of a story a burn error
was thrown. (Note: this only works for exceptions thrown by
C<throw_burn_error>.) [Scott]

=item *

Fixed the C<get_data()> and C<get_container()> element methods so that, in
list context, they return C<undef> instead of an empty list when there is no
corresponding field or element. This will be especially useful in templates,
where it will prevent errors such as Mason's, "Odd number of parameters passed
to component expecting name/value pairs." [David]

=item *

Renamed the C<related_instance_id> attribute of elements to
C<related_story_id>, for parity with C<related_media_id>--not to mention the
C<get_related_story()> method. The C<get_related_instance_id()> and
C<set_related_instance_id()> accessor methods remain in place for purposes of
backwards compatibility. [David]

=item *

Renamed "Element" to "Element Type" and "Element Type" to "Element Type Set".
This is to avoid confusing element types, which define the structure of
elements, and elements, which are contain content and are based on element
types. These are not ideal names, but at least we now have something different
to call them. The old C<get_element()> method and the accessors that get and
set C<element_id> or C<element__id> have also been renamed to
C<get_element_type()> and to access C<element_type_id>. [David]

=item *

Changed the attributes and objects that refer to the
Bric::Biz::ElementType::Parts::FieldType object in
Bric::Biz::Asset::Parts::Tile::Data from C<element_data_id> and
C<get_element_data()> to C<field_type_id> and C<get_field_type()>. [David]

=item *

Made the scroll bar "sticky" in the Story Profile, so that when you save a
story, the reload will scroll back to the same spot in the story profile where
you left odff. [Scott]

=item *

Added a "dialog box" widget for generating JavaScript-driven dialog boxes. The
buttons are nicely styled to match the Bricolage UI, and can be configured to
trigger JavaScript functions. Dialog boxes can also be dragged around the
browser window by grabbing their title bars. Used by the new Find/Replace and
Bulk Edit Cheat Sheet features, but will likely be used in other contexts in
the future. [David]

=item *

Normalized story and media elements and fields so that they no longer store
copies of their names, key names, and descriptions--and, in the case of
fields, the autopopulated and sql_type attributes--since these are actually
element type and field type attributes easily referenced in the element type
and field type tables. This change significantly reduces the size of the
database and has the potential to increase performance when getting and
setting field values, especially during publishes. [David]

=item *

Major refactoring of the field types class,
L<Bric::Biz::ElementType::Parts::FieldType|Bric::Biz::ElementType::Parts::FieldType>.
Attributes that describe how fields should be displayed are no longer stored
in a separate attribute object, but as true attributes of field type objects.
This makes them much more efficient in terms of database access. [David]

=item *

Added fuller management of field types in the Element Type Manager, such as
supporting the setting of a default value in a checkbox field in the field
profile. [David]

=item *

Added much more fine-grained field type management to the Element Type SOAP
interface. More field attributes can now be updated via SOAP. For example, one
can now change the widget type from "text" to "textarea". These improvements
are thanks to the normalization of the element type and field type classes.
Note that there are a number of new XML elements, and some of the existing
ones have changed names, but we have tried to preserve backwards compatibility
as much as possible. [David]

=item *

Added many new tests for the element type, field type, and element classes.
[David]

=item *

Renamed "Element Data" to "Field Type". [David]

=item *

Renamed a number of tables and appropriate foreign key columns, indexes,
constraints, and the like, to better reflect the names used for these things
in general. The tables renamed are:

=over

=item element to element_type

=item at_type to field_type

=item story_container_tile to story_element

=item story_data_tile to story_field

=item media_container_tile to media_element

=item media_data_tile to media_field

=item formatting to template

=back

[David]

=item *

Fixed a bunch of inconsistently named foreign key indexes. [David]

=item *

Renamed the Element and Element Type classes as follows:

=over

=item *

Bric::Biz::AssetType is now L<Bric::Biz::ElementType|Bric::Biz::ElementType>.

=item *

Bric::Biz::AssetType::Parts::Data is now
L<Bric::Biz::ElementType::Parts::FieldType|Bric::Biz::ElementType::Parts::FieldType>.

=item *

Bric::Biz::Asset::Business::Parts::Tile is now
L<Bric::Biz::Element|Bric::Biz::Element>.

=item *

Bric::Biz::Asset::Business::Parts::Tile::Container is now
L<Bric::Biz::Element::Container|Bric::Biz::Element::Container>.

=item *

Bric::Biz::Asset::Business::Parts::Tile::Data is now
L<Bric::Biz::Element::Container|Bric::Biz::Element::Field>.

=back

They now properly reflect what they're called in the UI, in SOAP, and in the
database. The old classes have been changed to simply inherit from the new
classes, so as to maintain backwards compatibility. [David]

=item *

Changed various C<get_data()>, C<set_data()> C<del_data()> and such methods to
C<get_field_types()>, C<get_value()>, C<set_value()>, C<add_field_types()>,
etc., to disambiguate fields from field types more consistently. These changes
are to the interfaces of L<Bric::Biz::ElementType|Bric::Biz::ElementType>,
L<Bric::Biz::ElementType::Parts::FieldType|Bric::Biz::ElementType::Parts::FieldType>,
and L<Bric::Biz::Element::Container|Bric::Biz::Element::Container>. The old
methods are of course left in place for purposes of backwards compatibility.
[David]

=item *

Added C<get_values()> and C<set_values()> methods to the field class
(L<Bric::Biz::Element::Field|Bric::Biz::Element::Field>) to make getting and
setting multivalue fields easier and more centralized. [David]

=item *

Removed the unused and meaningless C<referenced> attribute from
L<Bric::Biz::ElementType|Bric::Biz::ElementType>. [David]

=item *

Removed the unused and meaningless C<publishable> and C<map_type_id>
attributes from
L<Bric::Biz::ElementType::Parts::FieldType|Bric::Biz::ElementType::Parts::FieldType>.
[David]

=item *

Turned Bric::Biz::ATType into an appendix: something that's there, and may
have served a purpose in the past, but isn't needed now. All of its attributes
have been moved to L<Bric::Biz::ElementType|Bric::Biz::ElementType>, and you
should still be able to get the ATType object from existing elements, but new
elements won't need it anymore. It has been removed from the UI, but the SOAP
interface and the class itself remain for now. Bric::Biz::ATType will be
completely removed in a future version of Bricolage. [David]

=item *

The Element Type profile no longer displays the "Sites" section if there is
only one site, and no longer displays the output channel section if there is
only one output channel. [David]

=item *

Renamed Bric::SOAP::ElementType to Bric::SOAP::ATType, Bric::SOAP::Element to
L<Bric:SOAP::ElementType|Bric:SOAP::ElementType>, and
Bric::App::Callback::Profile::ElementData to
L<Bric::App::Callback::Profile::FieldType|Bric::App::Callback::Profile::FieldType>.
[David]

=item *

Added support for typical Windows character encodings. This means that users
can select "Windows Western (CP1252)" as their encoding in order to fix
gremlin characters pasted from Microsoft Word. [David]

=item *

It is now fatal to submit characters in an invalid encoding. For example, if a
user is using UTF-8 (the default) but pastes the contents of a Word document
with an m-dash (a CP1252 character), Bricolage will now throw an exception. It
probably threw an exception from the database in the past, but now we're
throwing one earlier. The solution for such a user is to of course select the
proper encoding in their "Character Set" preference. [David]

=item *

New categories now inherit all group memberships and permissions granted to
access assets in the category from their parent categories. This makes it far
easier for users with CREATE permission to categories to create new categories
without having to then edit group memberships and user group permissions to
make them the same as the parent's permission, which is what is usually
wanted. Of course, existing categories are unaffected, and if user needs
different group memberships or permissions than the parent, she will still
have to edit them. [David]

=item *

F<bric_republish> now uses the C<published_version> Bric::SOAP::Workflow
parameter to always republish the last version of a story to be published.
This means that even if a story is checked out, it can be republished without
interfering with the checkout.

=item *

The User and Contributor managers in the UI now use the List Name Format
preference to display the whole names for users and contributors. This allows
users to easily see whatever name parts they need by simply changing their
List Name Format preferences. [David]

=item *

Alert emails now use an email address, if one can be found, for the user who
triggered the alert event for the From header in the alert email. The
C<ALERT_FROM> F<bricolage.conf> directive is still used as the fallback.
[David]

=item *

The C<pre_path> and C<post_path> attributes of output channels have been
eliminated, since they can now be used directly in the URI formats. [David]

=item *

The admin tools are now listed in alphabetical order in the side navigation of
the UI. [David]

=item *

Added C<get_primary_category()> alias for C<get_category()> in the media
document class so as to make it more like the story class, thus making
dispatch simpler. [David]

=item *

Users creating media documents from within a related media element (because
the C<RELATED_MEDIA_UPLOAD> F<bricolage.conf> directive has been enabled and
they have the proper permissions) are now redirected to the "New Media"
profile when the new file has been uploaded, so that the element type,
category, cover date, priority, etc. can be changed. [David]

=item *

Story and media cover dates are now versioned. [David]

=item *

Output channels are now associated with burners and can only include other
output channels associated with the same burners. Element types are no longer
associated with burners at all. [David]

=item *

Renamed Bric::Biz::Asset::Formatting to
L<Bric::Biz::Asset::Template|Bric::Biz::Asset::Template>. [David]

=item *

Added the C<TT_OPTIONS> F<bricolage.conf> directive to allow Bricolage
administrators to pass template toolkit directive options to the Template
object when it is instantiated by the Template Toolkit burner. [David]

=item *

Added the C<COMPILE_EXT> option to the instantiation of the Template Toolkit
object in the Template Toolkit burner. This will cache compiled versions of
the templates so that they do not have to be parsed and compiled every time a
story is published. This should make the TT burner substantially faster.
[David]

=item *

Publish and distribution jobs are now tied to a specific version of a story or
media document, rather than the media document itself. This will allow a whole
series of publishes for versions of a document to be scheduled for execution
over time, as well as help to protect currently checked-out documents from
being mysteriously removed from workflow by scheduled publishes being
executed. Sponsored by Freerun Technologies. [David]

=item *

Searches now are remembered for each manager in the UI for as long as a
session lasts. So if you perform a search for element types, and then do a
search for stories or output channels, the last results you saw in the element
type manager will be there again when you return to it. [David]

=item *

Eliminated need for HTTP::BrowserDetect, since the UI is now completely
browser-neutral. [David]

=item *

Media files can now be uploaded in the New Media profile. [David]

=item *

Added events for adding subelement element types to element types. [David]

=item *

Any symbols exported by C<PERL_LOADER> code, plus those exported by
C<Bric::Util::DBI qw(:junction)>, are now imported into the Template Toolkit
stash for direct use in Template Toolkit templates, and into the PHP global
context for direct use in PHP templates. For example, the C<ANY> function can
now be used directly in TT templates and as C<$ANY()> in PHP templates. The
burner constants C<PUBLISH_MODE> and C<PREVIEW_MODE> can also be used
C<$PUBLISH_MODE()> and C<$PREVIEW_MODE()> in PHP) if the default
C<PERL_LOADER> in F<bricolage.conf> is left in place. But TT can't have
multiple symbols with the same names, so for each symbol exported, it adds to
the stash the first one it finds in this order: CODE, HASH, ARRAY, IO, GLOB,
FORMAT, and SCALAR. Use of imported functions in PHP templates requires
PHP::Interpreter 1.1.0 or later. [David]

=item *

The story, burner, element, and content variables are now globals in PHP
templates, rather than each being stored in a global $BRIC associative array,
which is now gone. This brings the style of PHP templates more in line with
that of Mason and Template Toolkit templates. [David]

##############################################################################

=head1 Version 1.9.0 "Punkin" (2005-08-19)

=head2 New Features

=over

=item *

Added C<MASON_INTERP_ARGS> F<bricolage.conf> directive to allow arguments to
be passed to the Mason template interpreter. [Scott]

=item *

Added support for sub-second precision to date and time management in
Bricolage. This means that dates can be stored in the database with
microsecond precision. This was done by modifying Bricolage's date and time
handling to use the DateTime module from CPAN under the hood. The upshot is
that you can use the full suite of C<strftime> formats supported by DateTime,
including the formats for milliseconds and microseconds. Sponsored by Alinghi.
[David]

=item *

Added new "Precision" option to DateTime fields added to elements and
contributor types. The supported precisions are "Year", "Month", "Day",
"Hour", "Minute", "Second", "Millisecond", and "Microsecond". For purposes of
backwards compatibility, the default precision for custom DateTime fields is
"Minute". Sponsored by Alinghi. [David]

=item *

Added C<preview_another_all_ocs()> and C<blaze_another()> to
Bric::Util::Burner. The former executes a preview for all of the output
channels a document is associated with. The latter takes a document for its
argument and calls C<publish_another()> in PUBLISH_MODE and
C<preview_another_all_ocs()> in PREVIEW_MODE. [Serge Sozonoff]

=item *

Added C<$INSTALL_VERBOSITY> makefile environment variable that, when set to
"QUIET", eliminates many of the questions asked during installation and
cloning, falling back on the default values. [Rod Taylor & Andrea Rota]

=item *

Added C<$USE_DEFAULTS> makefile environment variable that, when used with
C<$INSTALL_VERBOSITY>, will use platform-specific answers to all of the
installation questions. This allows for completely silent, customizable
installations, which are necessary for packagers. [Marshall]

=item *

Added C<make dev> makefile target for installing a development version straight
out of a Subversion checkout. It performs a standard installation, then
symlinks bin/, comp/ and lib/ back to the Subversion checkout. [Marshall]

=item *

Added C<RELATED_MEDIA_UPLOAD> F<bricolage.conf> directive that allows editors
to upload media files directly into an element profile if they have permission
to create media and to access a media workflow. This makes it a much simpler
process for editors to quickly associate media with story documents. The
uploaded media files will be created based on the media type element selected
from a select list, and given the same category, cover date, and priority as
the current document. Enabled by default. [JoE<atilde>o Pedro and David]

=item *

Added the element type and output channel modules to the SOAP interface.
[Scott]

=item *

Added the C<ENABLE_GZIP> F<bricolage.conf> directive to turn on compression of
the UI pages through C<mod_gzip>. This results in pages as much as fifteen
times smaller, with minimal extra server load. If C<mod_gzip> is found during
installation, the appropriate C<LoadModule/AddModule> lines will be added to
F<httpd.conf>. Disabled by default. Suggested by Rod Taylor. [Marshall]

=item *

Added "Show Alpha Search" preference that determines whether the alpha search
("A | B | C | ... [All]") links should be shown. The alpha search isn't very
useful because you can type the first letter in the textbox (or "%" for "All")
for the same results, and it supports only the ASCII alphabet. Alpha search is
now off by default. [Marshall]

=item *

Added C<MEDIA_UNIQUE_FILENAME> F<bricolage.conf> directive to allow the
file name of media documents to be set to a unique, automatically generated
file name on upload, (off by default). Also added the C<MEDIA_FILENAME_PREFIX>
directive for setting a prefix word, such as "media", to be prepended to the
file name if desired (off by default). [Paul Orrock / Digital Craftsmen]

=item *

Added support for the C<ANY()> function to pass multiple possible values for a
given parameter to the C<list()>, C<list_ids()>, and, where pertinent,
C<href()> methods in the following classes:

=over

=item L<Bric::Biz::ATType|Bric::Biz::ATType>

More classes will support it soon! [David]

=item *

Added support for associating secondary categories and output channels when
cloning a story. Sponsored by Alinghi. [David]

=item *

Added support for adding secondary output channels to a new clone by selecting
a group of output channels. All output channels in that group that are allowed
by the story element will be associated with the clone. This is an easy and
accurate way to add a bunch of output channels to a clone at once. Users must
have READ access to each listed output channel group. Sponsored by Alinghi.
[David]

=item *

Added C<MEDIA_UPLOAD_LIMIT> F<bricolage.conf> directive for setting a size
limit on uploaded media files. [Scott]

=item *

The URI formats are now more flexible. You can now use many more parts of the
cover date in the URI, and in whatever format you like. So you could have a
format of "/%{categories}/%Y-%m-%d/" and end up with the URI
"/foo/bar/2004-09-22/" if you wanted. Or even "/%{categories}/%Y/%V/" to get
the week number as part of the URI. You can also include your own text,
similar to the URI Prefix and URI Suffix fields, anywhere in the URI (e.g.
foobar in "/%{categories}/%Y/%m/foobar/%{slug}/". Suggested by David.
[Marshall]

=item *

Added a frame on top of the preview window with a "Repreview" link. This is
useful for previewing changes when you're developing templates. Rather than
having to save the template, go back to the workspace, repreview, and then go
back to the template profile, you can preview the story, then edit the
template and click "Repreview" as necessary after each save. [Marshall]

=item *

Added a pluggable authentication system. New authentication engines can be
created by simply implementing a module named C<Bric::Util::Auth*>, where "*"
is the name of the authentication scheme. The new scheme can then be used by
adding it to the new C<AUTH_ENGINES> F<bricolage.conf> directive. By default
only the existing authentication scheme is used. Sponsored by Kineticode.
[David]

=item *

Added support for authentication to Bricolage against an LDAP server. The new
C<LDAP_*> F<bricolage.conf> directives make it simple to configure Bricolage
to authenticate against any LDAP server. Includes support for authenticating
users only if they are members of a specific user group in the LDAP database.
Users must still exist in Bricolage, however. Sponsored by Kineticode. [David]

=item *

Added support for multiple WYSIWYG editors. The C<ENABLE_HTMLAREA>
F<bricolage.conf> directive has been replaced by the C<ENABLE_WYSIWYG> and
C<WYSIWYG_EDITOR> directives. You can now choose between htmlArea 3 and the
new Xinha, a more active fork of htmlArea (recommended). More editors possibly
coming soon. See L<Bric::Admin|Bric::Admin> for details. [Marshall]

=item *

Added C<AUTO_PREVIEW_MEDIA> F<bricolage.conf> directive. Enabling this
directive allows media files uploaded to a media document to be distributed to
all relevant preview servers as soon as the media document is saved. Sponsored
by Alinghi. [David]

=item *

Added a PHP burner. Implemented by George Schlossnagle of Omni TI consulting.
Sponsored by PT.com. [George Schlossnagle]

=item *

Added UUIDs to story and media documents. A UUID is a universally unique
identifier. The format for UUIDs has been described in RFC 4122, ITU-T Rec.
X.667 and ISO/IEC 11578:1996. In Bricolage, they are generated by
L<Data::UUID|Data::UUID>.

=item *

Creating a template that was deactivated now reactivates it instead of just
giving an error message. [Scott]

=item *

The "User Override" screen has been integrated into the "Users" screen since
the two pages are mostly redundant except for a few links. [Marshall]

=item *

User overrides are now recorded in the event log. Suggested by David.
[Marshall]

=item *

The UI now shows which user is logged in and includes a link to the user's
profile at the top of each page, above the log out button. Suggested by Philip
Brown. [Marshall]

=item *

All of the old "NUMERIC" columns have been removed from the database and
replaced with the more appropriate (and faster) "INTEGER", "SMALLINT", and
"BOOLEAN" data types. [Neil Conway & David]

=item *

Added C<exclude_id> parameter to the C<list()> methods of the story, media,
and template classes. This parameter can be used to exclude one or more asset
IDs from the list of objects returned by the call to C<list()> and friends.
Suggested by Curtis Poe. [David]

=item *

The C<get_desk_stamps()> method in the asset classes has been removed (it was
deprecated in Bricolage 1.8.4). The same goes for the C<required_satisfied()>
method in Bric::Biz::Workflow. Thanks to Marshall Roch for the spot! [David]

=item *

Users now must have at least READ permission to sources to add them to
stories. If upgrading from an earlier version of Bricolage, for purposes of
backward compatibility, members of the "All Users" group (that is to say, all
users) will be granted READ access to all sources. Change this permission to
limit access as appropriate. For new installations of Bricolage, the default
"Story Editors" and "User Producers" groups have READ permission to all
sources. Suggested by Simon Wilcox. [David]

=item *

There is now a "Preserve Template" (disabled by default) option in Bulk Edit
that retains leading spaces, trailing spaces, and line breaks. With this
option set, you can, for example, paste in poetry without it all ending up on
one line. [Marshall]

=item *

URI formats now require that the categories be a part of the format. [David]

=item *

When using the command line tools, you can now opt to be prompted for your
password rather than entering it on the command line, which would store your
plain text password in the shell history. [Marshall]

=item *

Added tests for the burners. This was important for thoroughly testing the new
PHP burner, but it will keep the other burners functioning well from here on
in, as well. [David]

=item *

Moved the C<burn_again> attribute from Bric::Util::Burner::Mason to
Bric::Util::Burner, since it could be useful to other burners, and since
Bric::Util::Burner had knowledge of it, anyway. [David]

=item *

The HTML::Template burner now sets parameters for all attributes of a story as
returned by the C<my_meths()> method of the story class, rather than just the
story title. So, for example, you can now use <tmpl_var primary_uri> or
<tmpl_var cover_date> with out creating a F<.pl> template to set them up.
[David]

=item *

Refactored the separate C<_add_resource()> methods in each of the burner
subclasses int Bric::Util::Burner itself. [David]

=item *

Arguments can now be passed to the C<display_element()> method of the Template
Toolkit burner and they will be set up as variables in the stash of the
execution context of the element template.

=item *

Category templates in the HTML::Template burner now cascade just like in all
the other burners, rather than stopping at the first category template found
in the category URI. Users of HTML::Template templates should take note of
this if they have more than one category template in their category URIs.
[David]

=item *

The HTML::Template burner now has access to both the related story and the
related media URIs via the C<rel_story_uri> and C<rel_media_uri> variables.
The old C<link> variable has been deprecated, since it cannot handle an element
that has both a related media and a related story. [David]

=item *

Major interface clean-up. The UI is finally mostly valid XHTML and uses CSS
for all styles. The C<USE_XHTML> directive, added in 1.7.0, is no longer used.
The file sizes of some pages have been reduced by as much as 70%, offering
improved page load times. Also, it will now be much easier to customize
colors, etc. by customizing the CSS stylesheet. [Marshall]

The desks/My Workspace have been slightly modified to be more usable. Most
notably, the "View" and "Edit" links (depending on checkout status) have been
moved to the asset's title, where the preview link formerly was, the
"Category" line has been replaced with "Primary URI", and the URI itself is
the preview link. Also, the "Site" line now only shows up when there is more
than one site. [Marshall]

=item *

Added C<MASON_STATIC_SOURCE> F<bricolage.conf> directive to enable static
sources in the Mason-powered UI. Enabling this directive can eliminate many
file system stats on every request, thus increasing performance. It's disabled

Changed the names of the attributes in Bric::Biz::AssetType and
Bric::Biz::AssetType::Parts::Data that have double underscores to have only

Distribution via any mover other than "File System" now correctly strips off

The Bulk Publish interface in the UI now displays the name of the site

The Burner C<publish()> method now sets the publish date to the current date

A media document that has a file uploaded to it before it is ever saved will

Publishing a document with a related document, where the related document is

Fixed sorting of SQL files for concatenation into F<inst/Pg.sql> so that it

A job no longer throws an exception when it can't get a lock on itself for

Related story and media elements managed through the SOAP server can now use a
combination of URI and site ID to identify related assets in addition to the
existing approach of using story and media IDs. [David]

Email sent by Bricolage now set the send date, since our understanding is

The media type manager now validates media type names to ensure that they are
of the form "type/subtype" with no spaces. Suggested by Marshall Roch. [David]

=item *

When started up by the super user, the virtual FTP server now runs as the same
user as the Bricolage Apache server. This should prevent malicious users of
the virtual FTP server from being able to do things as the root user that they
shouldn't. [Keith Grennan]

=item *

SQL errors encountered when building the database are now fatal, meaning that
they will cause the entire installation to fail, rather than continuing to
execute SQL statements and build an incomplete database. This prevents the
creation broken databases when people didn't notice errors in the past.
[David]

A list of subelements is now less likely to mysteriously become out of order
and thus lead to strange action-at-a-distance errors. And even if they do
become out of order, the error message will be more appropriate ("Warning!

Updated mail list information in L<Bric::Hacker|Bric::Hacker>. Reported by

The SOAP media interface now supports creating relationships between the media
documents elements and other story and media documents, just like the SOAP
story interface does. [David]

=item *

The SOAP interface now supports Related stories and media on story type and
media type elements just as in the UI. This involved the somewhat hackish
necessity for including the "related_story_id" and "related_media_id" (or
"related_story_uri" and "related_media_uri") attributes in the "elements" XML

C<make clone> now ignores files in the source directory that start with

Added F<contrib/bric_import_contribs> to import contributors from a
tab-delimited file. Development by Kineticode, sponsored by the RAND
Corporation. [David]

=item *

Added the C<published_version> parameter to the C<list()> methods of the
story, media, and template classes. This parameter forces the search to return
the versions of the assets as they were last published, rather than the most
recent version. This will be most useful to those looking up other documents
in templates and publishing them, as a way of avoiding pulling documents out
from other anyone who might have them checked out! [David]

=item *

For those using the Template Toolkit burner, the required version is now 2.14,
so as to take advantage of the improved Unicode support in that version.
[David]

All publishing and distribution jobs are now executed in their own
transactions when they are triggered by the user interface. This is to reduce
the chances of a deadlock between long-running publishing transactions.

The installer now requires PostgreSQL 7.3 or later. This is because 7.2

[David]

Added Russian localization. [Sergey Samoilenko].

=item *

Changed the foreign keys in the story, media, and formatting (template) tables
so that C<DELETE>s do not cascade, but are restricted. This means that before
deleting any source, element, site, workflow, or other related object that has
a foreign key reference in an asset table, those rows must be deleted.
Otherwise, PostgreSQL will throw an exception. Hopefully, this will put a stop
to the mysterious but very rare disappearance of stories from Bricolage.
[David]

=item *

The distribution monitor, F<bric_dist_mon>, no longer populates HTTP headers
with lists of Job IDs for execution. Instead, it simply sends a request to the
distribution handler, and Bric::Dist::Handler looks up the jobs to execute
itself. This fixes an issue with too many headers being put into the request,
and makes the operation of Bric::Dist::Handler more efficient. [David]

=item *

A call to C<< $burner->publish_another >> in a template that passes in a
date/time string in the future now causes a publish job to be scheduled for

Added output to the Apache log consisting of the 20 most recent events on an
asset that has lost track of what workflow and/or desk it is on. This is to
provide debugging information that might help us to track down when an asset
forgets its workflow and/or desk, so that we might eventually be able to
eliminate the code that picks up on this and corrects it. [David]

The distribution monitor, F<bric_dist_mon>, now prints error information to
C<STDERR> when there is an error, instead of just printing it to the system
log. [David]

=item *

Existing jobs are now executed within their own transactions, as opposed to no
transaction specification. This means that each job must succeed or fail
independent of any other jobs. New jobs are executed before being inserted
into the database so as to keep them atomic within their surrounding
transaction (generally a UI request). All this means that transactionality is
much more intelligent for jobs and will hopefully eliminate job table
deadlocks. Reported by Mark Jaroski, Serge Sozonoff, Patrick Michael Kane, and
others. [David]

The workflow, destination, and output channel profiles only display site

All templates now execute with UTF-8 character strings enabled. This means
that any templates that convert content to other character sets might need to
change the way they do so. For example, templates that had used
C<< <%filter> >> blocks to convert content to another encoding using something
like C<Encode::from_to($_, 'utf-8', $encoding)> must now use something like
C<$_ = Encode::encode($encoding, $_)>, instead. Bric::Util::CharTrans should
continue to do the right thing. [David]

=item *

Added C<encoding> attribute to Bric::Util::Burner so that, if templates are
outputting something other than Perl C<utf8> decoded data, they can specify
what they're outputting, and the file opened for output from the templates
will be set to the proper mode. Applies to Perl 5.8.0 and later only. [David]

=item *

Adding a new category to a group and asking it to cascade that group
membership into subcategories no longer causes an error. Thanks to Adam
Rinehart for the spot! [David]

=item *

Adding an existing publish desk to a workflow no longer unsets its publish
attribute. [David]

=item *

Deleted output channels no longer show up in the select list for story type
and media type elements. [David]

=item *

Deleting a workflow from the workflow manager now properly updates the
workflow cache so that the deleted workflow is removed from the left
navigation without a reboot. [David]

=item *

Creating a story, checking it in, checking it out, and then canceling the
checkout no longer incorrectly removes the story from workflow. [David]

=item *

The source of a story can now be changed. [David]

=item *

Status messages sent to the browser during previews are now hidden if an error
is triggered. [Marshall]

=item *

Publishing a document with deactivated related documents no longer causes
those deactivated documents to be published, too. Reported by Paul Orrock.
[David]

=item *

The Bricolage 404, 403, and 500 error pages now send the appropriate HTTP
header to the browser. Thanks to Marshall Roch for the spot! [David]

=item *

The Output Channel URI Prefix and URI Suffix fields are once again allowed to
include a slash (F</>). Reported by Kevin Elliott. [David]

=item *

An attempt to create a new template with the proper extension as part of the
name (e.g., F<foo.mc> for a Mason template) now keeps the extension instead of
changing the dot to an underscore and adding the extension (e.g., it stays
F<foo.mc> instead of becoming F<foo_mc.mc>). This is especially useful when
creating utility templates and for users of C<bric_dev_sync>. Thanks to Paul
Orrock for the spot! [David]

=item *

When Bricolage notices that a document or template is not in workflow or on a
desk when it should be, it is now more intelligent in trying to select the
correct workflow and/or desk to put it on, based on current workflow context
and user permissions. Reported by Hal Creech. [David]

=item *

Content submitted to Bricolage in the UTF-8 character set is now always has
the C<utf8> flag set on the Perl strings that store it. This allows fields
that have a maximum length to be truncated to that length in characters
instead of bytes. Thanks to Kang-min Liu for the spot! [David]

=item *

C<< Bric::Biz::OutputChannel->list_ids >> no longer returns duplicate
IDs. This incidentally allows output channels that happen to be in groups to
be edited, eliminating the 'name "Web" is already used by another Output
Channel' error. Thanks to John Greene for the spot! [David]

=item *

The media type of media documents now defaults to "none" instead of inserting
a C<NULL> into the database. The column has also be marked C<NOT NULL> in
order to ensure that this remains the pattern. [David]

=item *

Changed the "name" and "error_message" columns in the "job" table in the
database from C<VARCHAR> to <TEXT>. This is so that we don't have to truncate
them before inserting them. [David]

=item *

Elements with autopopulated fields (e.g., for image documents) can now be
created via the SOAP interface. Reported by Todd Tyree. [David]

=item *

Fixed a number of the parameters to the C<list()> method of the Story, Media,
and Template classes to properly handle an argument using the C<ANY>
operator. These include the C<keyword> and C<category_uri> parameters. Passing
an C<ANY> argument to these parameters before this release could cause a
well-populated database to lock up with an impossible query for hours at a
time. [David]

=item *

Restored foreign keys and constraints missing on the "job" table and related
tables since version 1.8.0. [David]

=item *

The error message for failed distribution jobs is now properly displayed in
the UI. [Mark]

=item *

Fixed bug with the execution of jobs in F<bric_queued>. [Mark]

=item *

Attempting to create a new desk with the same name as a deactivated desk
no longer returns an SQL error, but a more informative error.

=item *

Template sandboxes now work for the Template Toolkit burner. [David]

=item *

The output channel and element profiles no longer display deactivated output
channels in their output channel select lists (for output channel includes in
the output channel profile and for primary output channels in the element
profile). [David]

The side navigation layer now works correctly with Internet Explorer 5.5 for
Windows. [Marshall]

=head1 Version 1.8.1 (2004-07-08)

=head2 Improvements

=item *

More complete Traditional Chinese and Simplified Chinese localizations. Also,
the Mandarin localization now simply inherits from the Traditional Chinese
localization. [Kang-min Liu]

=item *

C<make clone> now copies the F<lib> directory and all of the F<bin> scripts
from the target to the clone, rather than from the sources. This allows any
changes that have been made to scripts and classes to be properly cloned.
[David]

=item *

When installing Bricolage, it will now allow you to proceed if the database
already exists by asking if you want to create the Bricolage tables in the
existing database. Suggested by Mark Fournier and Marshall Roch. [David]

=item *

Added some missing translations for English. [David]

=item *

The installer is now a bit smarter in how it handles loading the C<log_config>
(or C<config_log>, as the case may be) module. [Marshall Roch]

=item *

Added ID attributes to story, media, and element profiles and "fieldcontent"
class to content field values in the "View" screens so that they can be
used as CSS selectors. [David]

=item *

Added language-specific style sheets. This is especially useful for
right-to-left languages or for languages that require special fonts. [David]

=item *

The "New Alias" search interface now displays thumbnails when searching for
media documents to alias and the C<USE_THUMBNAILS> F<bricolage.conf> directive
is enabled. Reported by Serge Sozonoff. [David]

=item *

The C<has_member()> method of Bric::Util::Grp is now faster when searching for
a specific group member. [David]

=item *

Aliases can now be made to documents within the same site. [Serge Sozonoff]

=item *

When viewing the contents of a document, the contents now have their HTML
escaped. This prevents any broken HTML in the content from breaking the
Bricolage UI. Suggested by Neal Sofge. [David]

=item *

The SOAP interface for importing and exporting elements now properly has
"key_name" XML elements instead of "name" XML elements. The changes are
backwards compatible with XML exported from Bricolage 1.8.0 servers, however.
Reported by Tony Cowderoy. [David]

=item *

Added C<move()> method to the virtual FTP interface. This means that to deploy
a template, rather than having to rename it locally to append ".deploy", one
can simply move in FTP to its new name with ".deploy" on appended to the new
name. [JoE<atilde>o Pedro]

=item *

Document expirations are now somewhat more intelligent. Rather than just
scheduling an expiration job only if there is an expiration date the first
time a document is published, Bricolage will now always schedule an expiration
job for a document provided that one does not already exist (scheduled or
completed) for the same time and for one of the file resources for the
document. This should allow people to more easily and arbitrarily expire
content whenever necessary. Thanks to John Greene for the discussion that
finally motivated this change. [David]

=item *

Improved zh-cn translation. [Gang Luo]

=item *

Burner notes now persist for all sub burns (triggered by C<publish_another()>
and C<preview_another()> in a single burn. [Serge Sozonoff]

=item *

Keyword groups now properly display their members. [David]

=item *

Added ability to create and manage groups of objects for several different
types of objects. Also added the ability manage group membership within the
administrative profiles for those objects. This change makes it possible to
give users permission to administer subsets of objects. The new groupable
objects are:

The Bulk Publish admin tool is no longer limited to use only by members of the
Global Admins group. Now anyone can use it. All one needs is READ permission
to the categories of stories, and PUBLISH permission to the stories and media
documents to be published. [David]

Bulk Publish now ensures that users have at least READ access to categories
they wish to publish from. [Scott]

Eliminated 'Bareword "ENABLE_HTMLAREA" not allowed while "strict subs" in use'
warning that prevented startup for some installations. [Scott]

=item *

The Mason burner now appends a "/" to the end of the category path it
specifies for burning a story. This removes the ambiguity between a directory
request and a file request, which in rare circumstances could cause unexpected
problems. [David]

=item *

Changes made to user or contributor contacts without changing any other part
of the user or contributor object are now properly saved. [David]

=item *

When cloning a story, the list of output channels to select from is now
limited to the site the current workflow is in. Thanks to Serge Sozonoff for
the spot! [David]

=item *

The upgrade to 1.8.0 now correctly updates story URIs that use the URI Suffix
of an output channel instead of using the URI Prefix twice. [John Greene]

=item *

The Advanced Search interface for stories and media now displays only the
top-level elements associated with the site the workflow is in when searching
for stories and media "By Type". [David]

=item *

Improved error logging for more recent versions of Apache, which unfortunately
escape newlines. [David]

=item *

When Bricolage discovers a document or template on a desk but not in a
workflow, it now places it in a workflows associated with the same site as the
document or template is associated with. Thanks to Serge Sozonoff for the
spot! [David]

=item *

Aliases of Image, Audio, or Video media documents no longer remain stuck on
desks. Reported by Serge Sozonoff. [David]

=item *

Related media and story subelements of media documents now work properly.
Thanks to Kang-min Liu for the spot! [David]

The distribution and SOAP handlers now load a localization object so that any
code that uses localization will work properly. Reported by Clive Jones.
[David]

=item *

The C<set_page_extensions()> method of Bric::Util::Burner now throws an
exception if duplicate page extensions are passed, rather than deferring the
exception to the creation of a distribution job, which was confusing. [Clive
Jones]

=item *

Calls to C<preview_another()> in Bric::Util::Burner will now use any templates
in the current user's sandbox and properly burn them to the preview root
rather than to the staging root used for publishing. Reported by Serge
Sozonoff. [David]

=item *

Contributor fields for roles other than the default role now properly store
and retain their values. [David]

=item *

The virtual FTP server now properly checks out templates when a template is
uploaded and is already in workflow.

=item *

Uploading a non-existent template via the virtual FTP server now correctly
creates a new template. The type of template depends on the name of the
template being uploaded, and for element templates, on whether there is an
element with the appropriate key name. The user must have CREATE permission
to All Templates or to the start desk in the first template workflow in the
relevant site.

=item *

Reverting a document or template to the current version number now properly
reverts all changes to the time the user checked out the document or
template. Reversion is also a bit more efficient in how it looks up the
previous version in the database. [David]

=item *

The SOAP server now rolls back any changes whenever an error is thrown. This
prevents problems when a few objects are created or updated before an
exception is thrown. Now any error will cause the entire SOAP request to
fail. Thanks to Neal Sofge for the spot! [David]

=item *

Changing the "Size" display attribute of a field in the Field profile (a
subprofile of the Element admin profile) now properly causes the field to
actually display in the new size. Reported by Tony Cowderoy. [David]

=item *

The table of contacts in the alert type profile is now more like other tables,
in terms of border colors, etc. [David]

=item *

The Bulk Publish admin tool now only limits the category search to the current
site context if the "Filter by Site Context" preference is checked. [David]

The F<inst/upgrade/1.7.0/data_tile_key_name.pl> upgrade script now skips

When creating a new story without a slug, Bricolage will now autogenerate
a slug based on the title. [JoE<atilde>o Pedro]

Added single underscore parameters to the C<list()> methods of the Story,
Media, and Template classes to complement those that have the awful double
underscores. [David]

=item *

Made SOAP modules more tolerant of lack of sites in 1.6. [Scott]

=item *

The collection API now checks newly added members when deleting members. This
ensures that newly added objects won't be saved to the database if they are
deleted, first. [David]

=item *

Turned off browser autocompletion in the Server and User profiles. This
prevents some browsers (e.g., Camino) from filling in your username and
password where it doesn't belong. [David]

=item *

When the "Filter by Site Context" preference is enabled, it no longer filters
documents when searching for documents to alias. Reported by Patrick Walsh.
[David]

=item *

The "Cancel Checkout" button in the Story, Media, and Template profiles now
tries to do the right thing instead of just leaving the asset on a desk in
workfow every time. If the asset was just created by the user, it will be
deleted. If it was just recalled from the library by the user, it will be
removed from workflow and shelved in the library. Otherwise, clicking the

Story and Media SOAP calls now correctly use the element's key name to

=head1 Version 1.7.4 "Sacramento" (2004-03-18)

=head2 New Features

=over

=item *

Added "Bulk Publish" feature in ADMIN->PUBLISHING that lets members of the
Global Admins group publish story and media documents by category. [Scott]

=item *

Added C<notes()> method to Bric::Util::Burner, along with the accompanying
C<clear_notes()>. The C<notes()> method provides a place to store burn data
data, giving template developers a way to share data among multiple burns over
the course of publishing a single story in a single category to a single
output channel. Any data stored here persists for the duration of a call to
C<burn_one()>. [David]

=item *

Added new contributed scripts for Bricolage button generation. These scripts
use the Gimp to generate localized buttons for the Bricolage UI based on the
contents of an input file. See F<contrib/button_gen/README> for details.
[Florian Rossol]

=item *

Added support for icons for all media documents when the C<USE_THUMBNAILS>
F<bricolage.conf> directive is enabled. These rely on the presence of PNG icon
files for each MIME type in F<comp/media/mime>. Only one such icons is
distributed with Bricolage, F<comp/media/mime/none.png> (borrowed from the KDE
project under L<this license|http://artist.kde.org/new/license.html#others>),
which is the default icon when the MIME type of a media file is unknown or
when no icon file exists for the MIME type of the media file. Administrators
are free to add their own icons, and the C<copy_gnome_icons> script in
F<contrib> makes it easy to use GNOME icons. [David]

=item *

Added C<bric_template_diff> and C<bric_template_patch> scripts in
F<contrib/bric_template_diff>. These scripts can be used to sync templates
between two Bricolage servers. [Sam]

=item *

added C<bric_media_load> to C<contrib/>. This script copies media into
Bricolage while accounting for the new to update existing media. [Sam]

=item *

Added HTMLArea support. This adds a new type of field to be added to elements
and contributor types, "WYSIWYG". Such fields are then displayed in the UI
using HTMLArea, a WYSIWYG HTML editor. This can be useful in particular for
simple fields that often need emphasis added or links. It is not currently
available in Bulk Edit or Super Bulk edit. See L<Bric::Admin|Bric::Admin> for
installation and configuration details. [Eric Sellers]

=back

=head2 Improvements

=over

=item *

The list of categories for which permissions can be granted to user groups to
access the documents and templates in the category now displays the categories
for each site separately, so that categories with same URIs (such as for the
root category in each site) can be easily told apart. Reported by Ho Yin Au.
[David]

=item *

The list of workflows for which permissions can be granted in the permissions
page now includes the parenthesized name of the site each workflow is
associated with. [David]

=item *

Modified the indexes on the C<workflow__id> and C<desk__id> columns of the
story, media, and formatting (template) tables to be more efficient, being
indexed only when their IDs are greater than 0 (that is, when a story, media
document, or template is actually on a desk and in a workflow). [David]

=item *

Added a method C<is_fixed> to story and media objects, to determine whether
a business asset has a fixed URL (for example, a Cover page). Refer to
L<Bric::Biz::Asset::Business|Bric::Biz::Asset::Business>. [Scott]

=item *

Added the C<ENABLE_OC_ASSET_ASSOCIATION> F<bricolage.conf> directive
to remove the ability to associate output channels from the story
and media profiles. [Scott]

=item *

The element administration profile now automatically adds the currently
selected site context to new elements, thus generally saving a step when
creating new elements. [JoE<atilde>o Pedro]

=item *

Added an interface to 'Clone' for stories so that you can change the category,
slug, and cover date, because otherwise an identical story is created, which
would cause errors for some stories. Clones are no longer allowed to have URIs
that are identical to the stories they were cloned from. [Scott & David]

=item *

Added the ability to Delete from desks (same as My Workspace). Note however,
that you can't delete from a publish desk. [Scott]

=item *

Completely documented the document element classes:
L<Bric::Biz::Asset::Business::Parts::Tile|Bric::Biz::Asset::Business::Parts::Tile>,
L<Bric::Biz::Asset::Business::Parts::Tile::Data|Bric::Biz::Asset::Business::Parts::Tile::Data>,
and
L<Bric::Biz::Asset::Business::Parts::Tile::Container|Bric::Biz::Asset::Business::Parts::Tile::Container>.
This should make it a bit easier on templators learning their way around the
Bricolage API. [David]

=item *

Refactored quite a bit of the code in the element classes. Renamed the methods
with "tile" in their names to use "element" instead (but kept the old ones
around as aliases, since they're used throughout the UI). Added a few methods
to make the interface more complete. [David]

=item *

Modified the C<get_containers()> method of
Bric::Biz::Asset::Business::Parts::Tile::Container to take an optional list of
key name arguments, and to return only the container subelements with those
key names. This is most useful in templates, where it's fairly common to get a
list of container subelements of only one or two particular types out all at
once. It neatly replaces code such as this:

  for ( my $x = 1; my $quote = $element->get_container('quote', $x); $x++ ) {
      $burner->display_element($quote);
  }

With this:

  for my $quote ($element->get_containers('quote')) {
      $burner->display_element($quote);
  }

And is more efficient, too. [David]

=item *

Modified the C<get_elements()> method of
Bric::Biz::Asset::Business::Parts::Tile::Container to take an optional list of
key name arguments, and to return only the subelements with those key names.
[David]

=item *

Added the C<get_data_elements()> method to
Bric::Biz::Asset::Business::Parts::Tile::Container. This method functions
exactly like C<get_containers()> except that it returns data element objects
that are subelements of the container element. It also takes an optional list
of key name arguments, and, if passed, will return only the subelements with
those key names. [David]

=item *

The C<ANY()> subroutine will now throw an exception if no arguments are passed
to it. Suggested by Dave Rolsky. [David]

=item *

Added the C<unexpired> parameter to the C<list()> method of the story and
media classes. It selects for stories without an expire date, or with an
expire date set in the future. [David]

=item *

The "User Override" admin tool is now available to all users. But a user can
only override another user if she has EDIT permission to that other user. This
makes it easier for user administrators to masquerade as other users without
having to change passwords. [David]

=item *

Eliminated another SQL performance bottleneck with simple searches of media
assets. [JoE<atilde>o Pedro]

=item *

Images with no dimension greater than the C<THUMBNAIL_SIZE> F<bricolage.conf>
directive are no longer expanded to have one side at least C<THUMBNAIL_SIZE>
pixels, but are left alone. [David]

Thumbnails are now displayed when searching media to relate to an element.
[David]

=item *

Thumbnails are now displayed in related media subelements. [David]

Added C<preview_another()> method to Bric::Util::Burner. This method is
designed to be the complement of C<publish_another()>, to be used in templates
during previews to burn and distribute related documents so that they'll be
readily available on the preview server within the context of previewing
another document. [Serge Sozonoff]

=item *

Added the C<subelement_key_name> parameter to the C<list()> method of the
story and media classes. This parameter allows searches on the key name for a
container element that's a subelement of a story or media document. [David]

=item *

Added support for all of the parameters to the C<list_ids()> method of the
Story, Media, and Template classes to the C<list_ids()> method of the
corresponding SOAP classes. This allows for much more robust searches via the
SOAP interface. [David & Scott]

=item *

Eliminated C<login_avail()> PostgreSQL function, replacing it with a partial
constraint. This not only makes things simpler code-wise, but it also
eliminates backup and restore problems where the C<usr> table is missing. The
downside is that it requires PostgreSQL 7.2 instead of our traditional minimum
requirement of 7.1. So any PostgreSQL 7.1 users will need to upgrade before
upgrading to this version of Bricolage. Suggested by Josh Berkus. [David]

Bricolage works with Perl 5.6.x again, although it's pretty strongly
deprecated. Perl 5.8.0 or later is required for character set conversion and

Fixed API that was causing no elements to be returned on "Add sub-elements"
page, when "Filter by site context" was turned on. [JoE<atilde>o Pedro]

=item *

When the SOAP server serializes and deserializes element templates, it now
correctly identifies the element by its key name, rather than its name. Thanks

The template profile's "cheat sheet" of the subelements of an element now
correctly display subelement key names instead of munging element names, as
was required before version 1.7.0. [JoE<atilde>o Pedro]

C<< Bric::SOAP::Category->list_ids >> now converts site names to site IDs.
[JoE<atilde>o Pedro]

=item *

C<< Bric::Util::Burner->preview >> once again defaults to previewing in an
asset's primary output channel instead of using the element's primary output
channel. [JoE<atilde>o Pedro]

=item *

Added C<first_publish_date> attribute to the SOAP input and output for stories
and media. [David]

=item *

The category SOAP class now correctly calls C<lookup()> with the site ID to
prevent multiple categories with the same names but in different sites from
being looked up. [JoE<atilde>o Pedro]

User overrideable preferences are now properly checked for permissions to
allow users with READ permission to a user to see the permissions. [David]

Group management now works more correctly in user profiles where users have on
READ access to the user object. [David]

=item *

Removed queries added in 1.7.2 that were running at Bricolage startup
time. They could cause DBI to cache a database handle and return it after
Apache forks, leading to strange errors such as "message type 0x49 arrived
from server while idle", and occaisionally a frozen server. [David]

=head1 Version 1.7.3 (2004-03-01)

=head2 New Features

=over

=item *

The virtual FTP server now moves templates into workflow when they're uploaded
and puts them into the user's sandbox. This behavior allows the user to test
the template changes without imposing possible bugs upon other Bricolage
users. This approach is much safer than the previous behavior, which simply
checked in and deployed a template upon upload. Templates can still be
deployed via the virtual FTP server by appending ".deploy" to their names. The
original behavior of always deploying templates upon upload can be restored by
enabling the C<FTP_DEPLOY_ON_UPLOAD> F<bricolage.conf> directive. [David]

=item *

Added C<ANY> function to be used with select parameters to story, media, and
template (formatting) list. Pass a list of values to this function to have any
of of them match for a given parameter. This is especially useful for matching
on, say, a list of URIs or category IDs. This function is automatically
available in templates. [David]

=item *

Added a feature that counts characters used in a textarea subelement on the
fly. It displays this figure and the number of characters left, immediately
above the textarea. This feature is enabled when the Max size attribute for the
textarea is given a non zero value when adding it to the element profile
stage. The JavaScript will also not allow you to have more than max size
characters in the textarea by truncating the data to that number of characters
every time someone adds another character beyond the maximum. [Paul
Orrock/Digital Craftsmen]

=item *

Added a feature to display image thumbnails in the search results and active
view for media objects that are image objects. This feature uses the Perl
module Imager from CPAN and the relevant image library for each format you
want to display. It can be turned on or off using the C<USE_THUMBNAILS>
F<bricolage.conf> directive. See
L<Bric::Biz::Asset::Business::Media::Image|Bric::Biz::Asset::Business::Media::Image>
for more information. [Paul Orrock/ Digital Craftsmen]

=back

=head2 Improvements

=over

=item *

The F<bric_media_upload> contributed script now provides a more meaningful
error message when it can't find F<bric_soap>. [Dave Rolsky]

=item *

The F<bric_dist_mon> C<-U> option no longer requires that "/dist/" be at the
end of the URL. If "/dist/" is missing, F<bric_dist_mon> will append it.
[David]

=item *

More story, media, and template query optimization. [David]

=item *

The story, media, and template queries now use aggregates to create arrays of
group IDs, instead of returning a separate row for each individual group
ID. Since all story, media, and template objects are now returned in single
rows instead of potentially many rows, this greatly cuts down on the overhead
of fetching data from the database. Suggested by Josh Berkus; implementation
help from David Fetter. [David]

=item *

Thanks to the aggregation of group IDs into a single row for each story, media
and template object, the C<Offset> and C<Limit> parameters to the C<list()>
methods of the story, media, and template (formatting) classes are now handled
by the database back end, instead of in Perl space. This makes using these
parameters much more efficient.

=item *

Added C<-k> option to F<bric_ftpd> to kill a currently running virtual FTP
server. This is made possible by the addition of the new C<FTP_PID_FILE>
F<bricolage.conf> directive. [David]

=item *

Asset groups associated with categories are now activated or deactivated
whenever their corresponding categories are now activated or deactivated.
This prevents them from showing up in the permissions interface. [David]

=item *

Added a check box to the permissions interface to enable the display of
inactive groups. This is primarily so that permissions can be modified on
inactive category groups, since they still affect access to any documents and
templates in those categories, even after they're deactivated. [David]

=item *

Updated documentation to reflect the reality that one should really only use
Perl 5.8.0 and later if one needs to use any characters outside of ASCII.
[Andrea Rota]

=item *

Added C<FTP_UNLINK_BEFORE_MOVE> F<bricolage.conf> directive. This forces the
FTP mover to unlink an older version of a file before renaming the new version
to that name. This is necessary for some FTP servers that won't disallow
renaming a file to replace an existing file. [Andrea Rota]

=item *

Updated zh-cn and zh-tw localizations, translating all untranslated
messages and JavaScript messages. [Kang-min Liu]

=item *

Relabeled the "Pre" and "Post" attributes of output channels as "URI Prefix"
and "URI Suffix", respectively. [Serge Sozonoff]

=item *

Added C<get_element()> method to Bric::Biz::Asset::Business and deprecated the
C<get_tile()> method. This will make things a bit more consistent for template
developers, at least. [David]

=item *

Added C<primary_category_id> parameter to the story class' C<list()>
method. [David]

=item *

Updated the German localization. [Thorsten Biel]

=item *

Users can no longer sneakily add subelements for which they do not have at
least READ permission to the corresponding element via the Super Bulk
Edit. Reported by Patrick Walsh. [David]

=item *

The list of output channels available to be included in an output channel now
has the name of the site with which each is affiliated listed as well. This is
to prevent confusion between output channels with the same names in different
sites. [David]

=item *

Changed the vertical alignment of the labels for textarea fields in the story
profile to be consistent with the labels on the element profile. i.e. top
aligned. [Paul Orrock/Digital Craftsmen]

=item *

Made the default installed "Photograph" and "Illustration" media document
types true image objects, with autopopulated fields for height, width,
etc. Suggested by Simon Wilcox. [David]

=item *

Changed the default value of the C<SMTP_SERVER> F<bricolage.conf> directive to
localhost. This has a much greater chance of working than defaulting to the
value of the C<VHOST_SERVER_NAME> directive. [David]

=item *

Eliminated the term "Asset Type" from the UI, replacing it with "Element",
"Story Type Element", or "Media Type Element", as context demands. [David]

=item *

The Contributor manager no longer presents a "New" link if the Contributor
Type on which the contributor is based has no custom fields. This will prevent
folks from creating new contributor roles in the UI only to find that Bricolage
hasn't created them because there are no custom fields. [David]

=item *

In the formBuilder interface used by the Element and Contributor Type
profiles, the default maximum length of text and textarea fields is now "0",
or unlimited. [David]

=item *

When publishing from a publish desk, you can now uncheck related assets in
order to not publish them. You can also unset the C<PUBLISH_RELATED_ASSETS>
F<bricolage.conf> directive to never publish related assets. [Scott]

The C<simple> parameter to the Media class' C<list()> method works again. As a
result, so does "Find Stories" in the UI. [David]

The de-de localization library has been fixed so that it now works. [David]

=item *

Filter by site context now works. 'All sites' context now returns results from
all sites instead of none. [JoE<atilde>o Pedro]

=item *

Several Alert Type fixes. Rule regular expression matching (=~, !~) now
handles patterns containing slashes (important for URIs, for example).
Attributes no longer show up as stringified hash references in subject or
message variable substitution. C<$trig_password> was removed from the Profile
as it caused an error and was useless anyway. And finally, duplicate and
spurious attributes were removed from the rules and message variable
lists. [Scott & David]

=item *

Fixed Template Element list, where container elements appeared twice.
[JoE<atilde>o Pedro]

=item *

The deletion of a site now properly resets the workflows to be displayed in
the side navigation layer. [David]

=item *

Changes to site settings are now correctly reflected in the UI for all users
as soon as they are made. [David]

=item *

New media documents no longer attempt to validate URI uniqueness until a file
has been uploaded. [David]

=item *

Autopopulated fields in media elements can once again have their values
fetched in templates. This problem was due to bad key names being created for
new image elements created after upgrading to 1.7.0. [David]

=item *

The workflow profile no longer displays deactivated sites in the site select
list. Thanks to Serge Sozonoff for the spot. [David]

=item *

The upgrade script that adds the C<first_publish_date> attribute to the
database now properly sets that date for existing assets, no matter how many
"publish" events have been logged. There should be only one, but some systems
apparently have more. [Thorsten Biel]

=item *

Media, Story, and Template groups now properly display all of the permissions
that can be granted to user groups to access them. [David]

=item *

The "Next" button in the Element Type profile now correctly loads the next
page of the profile instead of returning to the manager. [David]

=item *

Fixed URI uniqueness upgrade scripts, which were having problems with
PostgreSQL permissions. [David]

=item *

C<make clone> works again. [David]

=item *

Fixed database building installer scripts to use the C<$PGHOST> environment
variable when it has been explicitly set to "localhost", both to override
existing instances of that variable on a system, and to allow tunneling
to work properly. [Thorsten Biel]

=item *

Distribution jobs can be edited via the UI again. Thanks to Marshall Roch for
the spot. [David]

=item *

Publishes once again work when the "Date/Time Format" preference is set to
something other than ISO-8601. Reported by Marshall Roch. [David]

=item *

C<bric_dist_mon> now I<correctly> appends "/dist/" to the end of the server
URL if it is not already appended. Reported by Marshall Roch. [David]

=item *

If a desk is in a template workflow and a story or media workflow, and you
attempt to publish a media or story document from that desk in the context of
the template workflow, it will now properly publish the story or media
document instead of throwing an error. Reported by Serge Sozonoff. [David]

=item *

Fixed previewing with multiple OCs. [Serge Sozonoff]

=item *

Fixed a bug in C<bric_soap story create/update> caused by refactoring in
version 1.7.0. Found by David during a demo. [Scott]

=item *

An attempt to preview a story for which no template exists now gives a
friendly error message again. This was broken by the change in 1.7.2 that made
the Mason burner use document templates as true dhandlers. [Dave Rolsky]

=item *

The workflow menus in the side navigation layer no longer disappear after a
server restart. Reported by Ben Bangert. [David]

The Mason burner's special C<< <%publish> >>, C<< <%preview> >>, and

=head1 Version 1.7.2 "Kat" (2004-02-12)

=head2 New Features

=over

=item *

Bricolage now has a much more robust security policy. Users with permission to
edit various objects and groups in the administrative interface can no longer
increase their permissions. Nor can they manage the membership of groups of
which they are not members or do not have EDIT access to the members. All this
is to prevent users from giving themselves higher permissions. [David]

=item *

Added C<publish_another()> method to Bric::Util::Burner. This method publishes
a document other than the one currently being published. This is useful when a
template for one document type needs to trigger the publish of another
document. [David]

=item *

Added new permissions "RECALL" and "PUBLISH". These permissions apply only to
asset groups, including desks, categories, and workflows. Now users must have
RECALL permission to recall assets from the library and bring them into
workflow, and PUBLISH permission to publish assets. This should make it much
easier to create more flexible permissions to manage approval
processes. [David]

=item *

Bricolage now supports per-user preferences. Admins can mark a preference as
overrideable, which allows users to set this preference to their preferred
value. [Dave Rolsky]

=item *

The character set and language preferences have been moved into the database,
so that these can be overridden by individual users if needed. [Dave Rolsky]

=item *

Added C<--published-only> option to F<bric_soap> and F<bric_republish> so that
the last-published version of a document can be republished, rather than the
current version. [Scott]

=item *

Added Bric::Util::Job::Pub. Publication can now be placed into a queue and
deferred until a scheduled time, instead of burning on command and
distributing later, Bricolage will now burn a story at the time of the
scheduled distribution. [Mark]

=item *

Added the C<bric_queued> daemon to take advantage of the new publication
scheduling of Bric::Util::Job::Pub. Together with the use of a carefully tuned
instance of Bricolage, these new features allow the Bricolage administrator
to control the amount of system resources given over to publishing. [Mark]

=item *

German localization completed. [Thorsten Biel]

=item *

Added C<get_parent()> method to Bric::Biz::Asset::Business::Parts::Tile. This
simplifies getting access to a parent element in an element template. [David]

=item *

Added User and Desk (asset) modules to the SOAP API, added asset commands
to the Workflow module, and made corresponding changes to bric_soap. [Scott]

=item *

Added C<burn_again> attribute to the Mason burner. This method can be called
from within a template to force the burner to burn the current page again,
creating a new file. This can be useful for creating multi-file output
without extra paginated subelements. [David]

=item *

Added zh-cn localization, with translation based on zh-tw. [Kang-min Liu]

=back

=head2 Improvements

=over

=item *

A field that is both required and repeatable now allows instances of the field
after the first instance to be deleted. Setting a field to required
essentially means that one must always be present in the UI. [David]

=item *

HTML::Template and Template Toolkit are now optional. If they're not installed
on your system, they won't be loaded by Bricolage. [David]

=item *

The default "Story Editors," "Media Producers," and "Template Developers" user
groups now have READ permission to the members of the "All Sites" group so
that they can properly select a site context and gain access to the workflows
in their site context. [David]

=item *

A number of improvements for the F<bric_media_upload> contrib script:

=over

=item Creates intermediate categories if needed.

=item Added a C<--skip-existing> directive.

=back

See the script's usage info for details. [Simon Wilcox]

=item *

Fixed upgrade scripts to be more intelligent in their handling of
transactions. They no longer allow SQL errors without failing the upgrade. The
upgrade scripts have also been updated to ensure successful upgrades to
Bricolage installations as far back as 1.4.0. [David]

=item *

C<make upgrade> now suggests that the user run C<make clone> on the existing
installation, and asks the whether to continue or not. This is to encourage
folks to have a good backup before upgrading, in case the upgrade fails.
[David]

=item *

Added C<element_key_name> parameter to the C<list()> method of the story,
media, and formatting classes. This makes it easier to use the name of a story
type element, media type element, or template element to search for assets,
rather than the C<element__id> parameter, which isn't as friendly. [David]

=item *

Added "Filter by Site Context" preference. When active, search results only
return assets relative to the site context instead of all the sites the user
has access to [JoE<atilde>o Pedro]

=item *

The Mason burner now uses document templates as true dhandlers, enabling full
Mason-style inheritance from autohandlers to work properly. [David & Dave

=item *

"All *" groups can now be accessed via the Group Manager. Their names and
memberships cannot be edited, but their permissions can. Inspired by a bug
report from Patrick Walsh. [David]

=item *

Queries for stories, media, and templates have been greatly optimized. Thanks
to a large database from I<The Register> and query optimization from Josh
Berkus (under sponsorship from WHO) and Simon Myers of GBDirect, searches for
stories in the UI are now 10-40 times faster than they were before (depending
on the version of PostgreSQL you're running). [David]

=item *

Added the C<story.category> parameter to the C<list()> method of
Bric::Biz::Asset::Business::Story. Pass in a story ID, and a list of stories
in the same categories as the story with that ID will be returned, minus the
story with that ID. This parameter triggers a complex join, which can slow the
query time significantly on underpowered servers or systems with a large
number of stories. Still, it can be very useful in templates that want to
create a list of stories in all of the categories the current story is in. But
be sure to use the <Limit> parameter! Thanks to Josh Berkus for his help
figuring out the query syntax. [David]

Templates are now correctly saved to the user's sandbox when "Save and Stay"

=item *

Added multisite support. Now all stories, media, output channels, templates,
categories, and workflows may be associated with different sites, and even
have the same names in different sites. This simplifies the management of
multiple Web sites with Bricolage. Story type and media type elements may be
shared between sites. Funded by Portugal Telecom Multimedia. [David, Arthur,
Garth, & JoE<atilde>o Pedro]

=item *

Added document aliasing. Stories and media in a site may now be aliased and
published in another site, as long as the elements on which they are based
are shared between sites. Control over the content of aliased documents
remains in the original site, thus ensuring the editorial integrity of the
document for that site. Funded by Portugal Telecom Multimedia. [David]

=item *

Changed element attribute "name" to "key name" to emphasize its uniqueness
within an element. Also changed the "Display Name" to "Label" [Garth]

Added a "key_name" attribute to elements as the system-wide unique key for
each element, rather than the name. The name is now used as a label. Note that
the key name only allows certain characters, as it is used to name the
template files that format the element. This makes the C<has_name()> method a
bit simpler -- and it can in fact be ignored in favor of
C<< $element->get_key_name eq $key_name >>. Thus there may be some warnings
if older name values are passed to C<has_name()>. [Garth]

=item *

Refactored Bric::Biz::Keyword. It is now more compliant with the standard API
as defined in other classes. Also added support for keyword groups so that we
can create a keyword manager. [David]

=item *

Added C<< $burner->sdisplay_element >> method to Bric::Util::Burner. This is a
C<sprintf>-style version of C<< $burner->display_element >>. [Scott]

=item *

Added C<get_data_element()> method to
Bric::Biz::Asset::Business::Parts::Tile::Container. This allows template
writers to more easily find a single data element object, rather than just the
value of a single data element (as C<get_data()> does). Inspired by a comment
from Bill Cappel. [David]

=item *

Added the C<YEAR_SPAN_BEFORE> and C<YEAR_SPAN_AFTER> F<bricolage.conf>
directives. These directives control how many years before and after
the current year to display in the list of years in the date and time select
widget. The default values are 10 for each, meaning that if the current year
is 2003, then the date span will be from 1993 to 2013.

=item *

Added the C<ENABLE_SFTP_V2> F<bricolage.conf> directive to make
SSH protocol 2 be tried first. [Scott]

=item *

Added "Email" action, which can be used to email the files generated by a
publish to one or more email addresses. Funded by ETonline. [David]

=item *

Callbacks were moved from Mason components to modules based on
Params::Callback and managed by MasonX::Interp::WithCallbacks. This makes the
UI layer more responsive and enhances maintainability. [Scott]

=item *

Optimized performance of URI uniqueness checks by adding database tables to do
the job, rather than constructing the URIs for all other documents in the same
categories as the document being checked. This was the last major bottleneck
affecting SOAP performance, as well as document editing in general. Funded by
Kineticode. [David]

=item *

Added C<instance()> class method to Bric::Util::Language, so that non-OO
functions can get access to the current language handle. [David]

=item *

Added C<output_channel_id> parameter to the C<list()> methods of Story and
Media to enable querying for documents in output channels other than the
primary output channel. Based on a patch from Clive Jones. [David]

=item *

Lots of notification message localization fixes. [Radu Greab]

Status message localization fixes [David]

=item *

Added "search by element type" to Advanced Search of the Find Stories

the default search when you go to those screens. [Scott]

=item *

Added "Select all" button to select all the checkboxes on publish desks or My
Workspace. [Scott]

=item *

Added Keyword Management interface to centrally manage keywords. [Scott]

=item *

Added C<--workflow> and C<--desk> options to create and update commands of
C<bric_soap>, so that assets can be moved to a desk at the same time as
creation or updation. [Scott]

=item *

Added Group Membership sections to most of the profiles. [JoE<atilde>o Pedro]

=item *

Some optimizations to Bric::SOAP::(Media|Story|Template) classes. [Scott]

=item *

Added HTML::Mason Custom tags support, allowing template developers to write
code blocks that are context sensitive. See L<Bric::AdvTemplates> for
documentation on this. [JoE<atilde>o Pedro]

=item *

Added new page extension support to the burner, which allows template
developers to set string extensions to use for successive file names, rather
than the traditional use of numeric file name extensions for successive file
names. [Clive Jones]

=item *

Added "Text to search" option in the Advanced search of Media and Stories to
search for documents based on the contents of their field. [JoE<atilde>o
Pedro]

=item *

All preview links are now generated by a single widget. This widget adds the
story or media URI to the "title" attribute of the link tag (which is modern
browsers will automatically work as a roll-over tooltip), makes the story or
media URI copyable (by relying on JavaScript to actually open a new window for
the preview), and manages selecting an output channel in which to preview a
story. [David]

=item *

Made User Group Permissions UI wieldy with larger numbers of users by adding a
select list to choose which type of Permission to look at. [Scott]

=item *

Added ability to preview stories in a selection of output channels in the View
(read-only) story profile. [David]

=item *

Combined the asset "Find" managers into a single component, thus eliminating a
lot of redundant code. [David]

=item *

Added C<contrib_id> parameter to the C<list()> methods of
Bric::Biz::Asset::Business::Story and Bric::Biz::Asset::Business::Media to
return a list of story or media documents associated with a given
contributor. [David]

=item *

Switched Bric::Util::CharTrans from using Text::Iconv to Encode, thus removing
the dependency on a C library (libiconv). Note that this has changed the API
of Bric::Util::CharTrans. Its C<to_utf8()> and C<from_utf8()> methods now
always convert the argument passed in in place. They did this before for
references, but now they do it for plain strings, as well. Also note that use
of character translation also now requires Perl 5.8.0 or later. [Scott &
David]

=item *

Factored out some of the SOAP asset classes into Bric::SOAP::Asset. [Scott]

=item *

Added MediaType, Site, and Keyword SOAP modules. [Scott]

=item *

Changes to a story's slug, cover date, or primary category will now be
displayed before the story is saved. Suggested by a coworker of Andy
Baio. [David]

=item *

The Find Stories, Find Media, and Find Templates interfaces now disallow
searching for and returning all of the stories and media in the database. This
will help prevent thousands or tens of thousands of assets from being
displayed in the UI and sucking up all the resources on the server. [David]

=item *

Added "element" attribute to Bric::Util::Burner so that
C<< $burner->get_element >> should always return the element currently being
burned. [David]

=item *

Added burner-specific exceptions with context information, including current
output channel, current category, and current element. [David]

=item *

Added a C<throw_error()> method to Bric::Util::Burner so that template developers
can easily throw an exception that their users will see in the UI. [David]

=item *

Added C<best_uri()> method to Bric::Util::Burner to return the most
appropriate URI (in Bricolage's opinion) for a document. Mainly useful when
multiple sites and document aliases are used. [David]

=item *

Greatly simplified burner subclassing by adding a new registration method to
Bric::Util::Burner. This cuts down on the number of files that need to be
edited to add a new burner. [David]

=item *

Moved category selection from Media and Story Profiles into their own separate
components so that organizations with hundreds or thousands categories don't
have to load them into a dropdown list every time an asset is edited. The
category "browser" uses an interface similar to 'Associate Contributors',
which has the advantage of being searchable rather than looking through a
"long list of all categories". This feature can be enabled via the new
C<ENABLE_CATEGORY_BROWSER> F<bricolage.conf> directive. [Scott]

=item *

Added list paging to Desks and My Workspace. [Scott]

=item *

XHTML/CSS-ized desk items. This approach is the future of the Bricolage
interface: purely structural HTML, with CSS to create the presentation.
Eventually, we'll be able to have UI preferences to change font sizes or the
entire look and feel just by switching style sheets. But for now, this change
should help with the display of desks with many items on them, and it should
also speed the display of such desks. Turn off the C<USE_XHTML>
F<bricolage.conf> directive to get the old desk views back (useful for older
browsers). [David]

=item *

Added a preference to set the default Story/Media sorting. [Scott]

=item *

Added the ability to test templates without having to deploy them by using
"template sandboxes" for each template developer. [JoE<atilde>o Pedro]

=item *

Added Template Toolkit burner support. [Arthur/Fotango]

=item *

Added a F<bricolage.conf> directive, C<ALLOW_SLUGLESS_NONFIXED>, to prevent
slugless non-fixed (non-Cover) stories. [Scott]

=item *

Added support for installing and upgrading Bricolage with PostgreSQL on a
separate host. [Thorsten Biel]

=item *

Added context-sensitive help for pages that were missing it. [Scott]

=item *

C<make upgrade> no longer simply overwrites the contents of the UI component
root (F<$BRICOLAGE_ROOT/comp>), but renames it F<$BRICOLAGE_ROOT/comp.old> and
writes out a new one. This is both so that deleted UI component files don't
remain behind after an upgrade, and so that users can access any files that
they've changed in the old component root. Most users can just delete it after
upgrading. [David]

for them. [David]

=item *

When a story or media document is published, Bricolage now looks to see if any
files distributed for previous versions of the document are no longer
associated with the document, and expires them if they are. It does so on a
per-output channel basis, so note that if output channel settings have changed
since the document was last published, the expiration may miss some stale
files. The same goes for when destinations are changed. But this should cover
the vast majority of cases.

=item *

Fixed error looking up alert types in the database, which affected the alert
type manager on some platforms. Reported by Radu Greab. [David]

=item *

Deactivated alert types are once again available via the UI. [David]

=item *

Text input fields no longer impose a default maximum field length. This is so
that element fields that have their maximum length set to 0 can truly be
unlimited in length. Reported by Kevin Elliott. [David]

=item *

Template output channel associations no longer trigger an error when importing
templates via the SOAP interface. [Clive Jones]

=item *

Passing an undef via the C<workflow__id> parameters to the C<list()> method of
Story, Media, or Template once again causes Bricolage to correctly return only
those assets that are not in workflow. Reported by Kevin Elliott. [David]

=item *

Extra blank lines between subelement tags in super bulk edit no longer causes
an error. Thanks to Kevin Elliott for the spot! [David]

=item *

Searches no longer return unexpected results or all objects when pagination is
enabled. Thanks to Kevin Elliott for the spot! [David]

=item *

The searches for documents by beginning and ending cover dates were not
inclusive of the end date. Now they are! Reported by Kevin Elliott. [David]

=item *

Fixed spelling of "contributor" in the description of the contributor type
class in the database. Noticed by Radu Greab. [David]

=item *

Fixed a bug in Bric::SOAP::Media which was causing all media files uploaded
with that module to be placed in C<comp/data/media/$version/> rather than
C<comp/data/media/$id/$version/>. [Mark]

=item *

Fixed SQL bug that might in rare situations cause element output channel
associations to become confused. [David]

=item *

Fixed issue where new output channels added to a document type element were
not always actually saved as a part of that element. [David]

=item *

Fixed side navigation spacer graphic to the same width as other such
graphics. Helps Chinese Traditional to display more nicely. [Kang-min Liu]

=item *

The media simple search now searches by URI again. [Mark]

=item *

Now HTML-escaping the contents of the context content displayed for
subelements so as to prevent HTML in fields from messing up the display.
[Mark]

Fixed installer to again work with versions of PostgreSQL prior to 7.3. Thanks
to Marc Hawson for the spot. [David]

=item *

Fix for 'Can't call method "out_method" on an undefined value' generated
during a burn. [Mark]

=item *

Many minor HTML corrections. [Gerfried Fuchs]

=item *

Fix for SQL error when searching for media by file name. [David]

=item *

Eliminated 'Can't locate object method "redirect" via package
"HTML::Mason::Request"' error that caused Bricolage to actually display a
generic error page, instead of its custom error page. [David]

=item *

Alert types can once again be deleted from the alert type profile. [David]

=item *

Users can now only add subelements to a story if they have at least READ
permission to those subelements. Thanks to Mark for the spot. [David]

=item *

If the installer notices that you're attempting to install Bricolage in a
directory with an existing installation, it will suggest that you consider
running C<make upgrade>, instead. Suggested by Bruce Albrecht. [David]

=item *

The list manager now sorts version numbers as numbers rather than strings.
[JoE<atilde>o Pedro]

=item *

The media type profile again allows extensions to be added and removed.
Reported by Tobias Kremer. [David]

=item *

Added the C<CHAR_SET> directive's value to Bricolage's Apache configuration
via the F<httpd.conf> directive C<AddDefaultCharset>. Might help with some
Unicode issues. [David]

=item *

Distribution error handling is better now, with errors passed back to the
client and an error when F<bric_dist_mon> attempts to connect to a server or
URL that's not a Bricolage distribution server. [David]

=item *

Eliminated installation error 'Failed to create database: parser: parse error
at or near "template0"', which occurred with versions of PostgreSQL prior to
7.3. [Scott]

=item *

Enabled the C<PERL_LOADER> F<bricolage.conf> configuration directive and gave
it a default value that's actually useful. [David]

=item *

Pagination now works properly when searching for groups by type in the group
manager. [Scott]

=item *

Pagination now works properly when searching for elements by element type in
the element manager and when searching for contributors by contributor type in
the contributor manager. [David]

=item *

Creating a new story that has a URI that conflicts with an existing story no
longer creates an extra story. Reported by Clive Jones. [David]

=item *

Changed "Cannot publish asset because there are no Destinations associated
with its output channels" to instead include the name of the output channel
missing Destination associations so that the user can tell which output
channels need a Destination association. [Clive Jones]

=item *

When an document's primary output channel has been changed to something other
than that defined by its document type element, preview will now correctly
use the document's primary output channel instead of the element's primary
output channel. [David]

Returning to a desk from editing an asset that was selected for editing from
that desk no longer triggers an error. Thanks to Clive Jones for the spot!

localized images. [JoE<atilde>o Pedro]

=item *

Documents are no longer distributed to deleted (deactivated) destinations.
Reported by Mark. [David]

=item *

Eliminated several error log authentication message such as "No cookie found."
This tended only to confuse users when they were just starting to use
Bricolage. I've left in a few error messages, however, so that system
administrators can see in the log when it looks like someone is trying to hack
into Bricolage. The remaining authentication error log messages are:

=over

=item *

Invalid username or password. Please try again.

dependency between the "usr" table and the C<login_avail()> PostgreSQL
function. [David]

=item *

The FTP distributor now deletes existing copies of files before renaming a
temporary file when connecting to Win32 servers. This is because the IIS FTP
server doesn't seem to support renaming a file to the same name as an existing
file. [David]

=item *

Creating the database during C<make install> no longer fails if someone
is already connected to template1. [Scott]

=item *

A preview link is no longer in the "Find Media," "Active Media," desk, or "My

=item *

Various localization fixes. [Scott]

=item *

Fixed event logging for element fields. [David]

=item *

Media assets that are based on "Image", "Audio", and "Video" element types now
properly show up on desks. Note that existing media assets missing from desks
should be checked out via "Active Media" and moved to a new desk. [David]

=item *

Documented the support for passing C<%ARGS> to C<< $burner->display_element() >>
in templates. It was added to Bric::Util::Burner::Mason a while ago, but I
forgot to document it! Thanks to Mike Slattery for the spot. [David]

=item *

Added Crypt::SSLeay to the list of optional modules to be installed. This
module is required for SOAP communications over SSL. So if you use SSL and you
use the SOAP server, you'll want to install it. [David]

=item *

Fixed alerts so that alerts are once again sent to the members of groups.
Reported by Paul Cory. [David]

=item *

Deleted alert types are no longer displayed in the Alert Type Manager. Thanks
to Paul Cory for the spot! [David]

=item *

Added more intelligent code using HTTP headers instead of HTML to prevent
browsers [IE] from caching pages. [David]

=item *

Bricolage no correctly sets the HTTP headers for the content language and
character set. Thanks to Nathan Ollerenshaw for the spot! [David]

=item *

C<make clone> now changes the user and group ownership on the cloned files to
the values for the current user (root). This is to avoid problems when
C<tar>ing up those files. [David]

=item *

Added code to Apache configuration to force JavaScript files to be served with
the proper character set HTTP header. Those who use manual Apache configuration
along with Bric::App::ApacheStartup will want to add the following configuration
directive to your F<httpd.conf>:

  <Location /media/js>
    ForceType => "application/x-javascript; charset=utf-8"
  </Location>

=item *

The virtual FTP server no longer displays templates in subcategories of the
current subcategory directory. Thanks to George Harrison for the spot! [David]

=item *

Output channel associations in story type and media type elements can now be
deleted again. Thanks to Arthur Bergman for the spot! [David]

Added listing of emeritus developers. Otherwise Sam was simply listed as a
patcher, which is hardly accurate. [David]

=item *

The element profile no longer displays deleted fields after clicking the "Save

=head1 Version 1.6.0 (2003-04-29)

=head2 New Features

=item *

Added the C<STORY_URI_WITH_FILENAME> F<bricolage.conf> directive, which, when
enabled, allows story URIs to include the file name. This is especially useful
in output channels where "Use Slug as File name" is enabled, since it allows
stories to essentially have identical URIs except for the file name. Off by
default. [David]

Added F<bric_media_upload>, a media file bulk import utility, into
F<contrib>. Thanks to Matt Vella for the contribution.

=item *

Added keyword support for media assets to SOAP interface. [David]

=item *

Neatened the "Find Stories," "Active Stories," "Find Media," and "Active

their titles. [David]

=item *

Added Field Profile, so that element Fields can be edited. This is a marked
improvement over the old interface, which required that fields be deleted and
recreated if users wanted to change them. [Scott]

=item *

Granting of permission to database objects during installation has been moved
to its own make target. This is to allow it to be run by C<make upgrade>, too,
thus ensuring that the Bricolage database user always has the appropriate
permissions to access the database. [David]

=item *

Assets can once again be removed from workflow. [David]

=item *

The published version attribute is now set on templates when they're
deployed. Thanks to Geoff Richards for the spot. [David]

=item *

The F<bricolage.conf> and F<httpd.conf> files are now created during C<make>
rather than C<make install> so that C<make test> can take advantage of them.
[David]

A value of "0" (zero) can now be given to element fields. This bug has been in
Bricolage since the beginning! Thanks to Mark for the spot. [David]

=item *

Stories with subelements containing no field elements no longer cause an
error when the container profile is looking for contextual information to
display about a a subelement. Thanks to Chris Jantzen for the spot. [David]

=item *

Bulk editing a field without first going through the element profile and
without adding or removing or reordering field elements now preserves the
data. This is another bug that has been in the code since the beginning of
time, and was only recently identified. Thanks to Rachel Murray for the spot.
[David]

=item *

Fixed an obscure bug where an element with a field element and a container
element with the same ID could cause an error when one tries to edit the
container element and Bricolage tries to load the field element,
instead. Embarrassingly discovered in the middle of a presentation to the
London Perl M[ou]ngers. [David]

=item *

Minor JavaScript fix for Opera users, thanks to Kevin White. [David]

=item *

The "multi" installation method now defaults the "Bricolage Root Directory"
setting to F</usr/local/bricolage> instead of "NONE". This seems to be less
annoying to people. [David]

=item *

The F<inst/upgrade/1.5.1/asset_desk.pl> script, which is run by
C<make upgrade>, now correctly checks to see if the upgrade has already been
performed. [David]

=item *

The F<inst/upgrade/1.5.1/webdav_mover.pl> script, which is run by
C<make upgrade>, now correctly checks for the existence of the correct record
in the "class" table before inserting a new record. [David]

=item *

During C<make upgrade>, the upgrade scripts are now run I<before> the new APIs
are installed, so that there are no conflicts when using the existing API to

Creation and installation of man pages can now be avoided during
C<make upgrade> as well as during C<make>. [David]

=item *

Man pages will now be installed in the correct subdirectory of
C<$BRICOLAGE_ROOT> when using the "multi" install method. [David]

Out of the box, the Story Editors, Media Producers, and Template Developers
groups now have READ permission to access members of the "All Categories" and
"All Elements" groups, which allow them to actually create assets based on
elements and within categories. [David]

=item *

Workflow and Desk permissions are a little more sensible now. CREATE
permission can be granted for the start desk in each workflow, instead of for
the entire workflow. This allows a lower permission to be set on the workflow
(e.g., READ), and then higher permissions on the individual desks in the
workflow. [David]

=item *

New "Tuning" sections have been added to L<Bric::DBA>. [Mark]

=item *

The default required length for usernames and passwords has been changed from

It is once again possible to delete elements when they are not associated with
any story or media asset. [David]

=item *

The output channel profile once again only complains that the name of an
output channel is already in use if it happens to be true. [David]

=item *

Bric::Config now does its best to find a workable F<httpd.conf> file during
C<make test>. [David]

=item *

Subclasses of Bric::Biz::Asset::Business::Media work again, and can have
keywords associated with them, too. [David]

=item *

The "Access Denied" message is back for when someone tries to access an object
to which they don't have adequate permission. [David]

=item *

Previews of assets that are not checked out work again. [David]

=item *

Workflow and desk permissions relative to the assets they contain are now
restored to their previous behavior. Desks no longer simply inherit the
permission granted on any of the workflows they're in. This issue was resolved
by creating a new secret asset group ID for each workflow. [David]

=item *

The primary output channel is now always enabled by default in top-level
elements. This is to make it much harder to create documents without output
channel associations, an event that can lead to database exceptions. [David]

=item *

The root category now lists itself as being in the "All Categories" group only
once in the category profile. [David]

=item *

Assets will no longer appear to randomly disappear from workflow. [David]

=item *

Added constraints to the "media_type_member" group that were inadvertently
left out of 1.5.1. [David]

=head1 Version 1.5.1 (2003-03-23)

=head2 New Features

=over

=item *

Lots of group-related optimizations. These should greatly improve the speed
with which permissions are checked. [David]

=item *

Improved testing support with lots more tests. Many more remain to be
written. See the new testing documentation in L<Bric::Hacker|Bric::Hacker> for
details. [David]

=item *

Added ability to publish assets at a future time to Bric::SOAP::Workflow.
Includes addition of new C<--publish-date> option to F<bric_soap>. [David]

=item *

Added WebDAV mover. [JoE<atilde>o Pedro]

FTP and File System movers now atomically copy files to their destination
servers. [JoE<atilde>o Pedro]

=item *

Added "All Desks" group for managing the permission to access all desks.
[David]

Refactored and optimized the code used in the C<lookup()>, C<list()>,
C<list_ids()>, and, where pertinent, C<href()> methods in the following
classes:

=over

=item Bric::Biz::Asset

=item Bric::Biz::Asset::Business

This work will allow permission checking to be much faster for objects of
these classes, as the relevant group IDs are now looked up for each object
when the object is looked up, rather than by a separate select for each
object, one-at-a-time. The changes also include support for a C<grp_id>
parameter to be passed to the C<list()> method of these classes as a way of
allowing a group to return a list of the objects in the group en masse, rather
than one-at-a-time from the member objects of each group. Once similar
optimizations have been made to the Bric::Biz::Assest classes, the necessary
change will be made to Bric::Util::Grp to allow this functionality. [David and
Mark]

=item *

Added object caching to the base class, and calls to it from all classes with
a C<lookup()> method to take advantage of it. The caching is only for the
duration of a request for now, but can be expanded later. [David]

=item *

Updated F<INSTALL.MacOSX> to reflect changes thanks to the new Mac OS X
support included in libapreq 1.1. [David]

=item *

Added "Super Bulk Edit", which is a bulk edit interface allowing users to
edit all of the fields in an element at once using POD-like tags, rather than
just a single repeatable field. [Garth]

=item *

Added help topic for new "Super Bulk Edit" feature. [David]

=item *

Localization and Internationalization support introduced, with a Portuguese
library to complement the default English. Most message strings have been
replaced with calls to the proper localization method. Still to be done are
strings fetched from the database (e.g. events). [ClE<aacute>udio Valente]

=item *

Localization of text images (buttons), Help, and JavaScript message added.
These still need translation, however. [David]

=item *

Added Italian translation. [Marco Ghezzi]

=item *

Documented F<bric_dist_mon> and F<bric_ftpd>. [David]

=item *

Optimized and added tests for Bric::Util::Priv's C<get_acl()> and
C<get_acl_mtime()> methods. These should make the looking up of a user's
access control list faster. [David]

=item *

Added preview link to every element profile of a story profile. [Scott]

=item *

Pared down number of default User groups by eliminating those that relate to
only a single admin menu item. [David]

=item *

Fixed code in Bric::Util::Grp where the C<has_member()> method would fail to
look up an object with an ID of 0. [JoE<atilde>o Pedro]

=item *

Switched exceptions from home-grown to using Exception::Class. [Scott]

=item *

The installer now offers a more meaningful message when it encounters an
existing database and the user doesn't want to drop that existing database.
[David]

=item *

Added category group association, including ability to cascade membership
assignments into subcategories, to category profile. [JoE<atilde>o Pedro]

=item *

The installer will no longer try to load CPAN.pm if all modules are already
installed. Thanks to Ilia Chipitsine for the prodding. [David]

=item *

The "Content" section of story, media, and subelement profiles now attempts to
display a bit of text from the first text field in each listed subelement so
that it's easier to see at a glance which subelement is which. [JoE<atilde>o
Pedro]

=item *

Switched POD testing from Pod::Checker to Test::Pod (using Pod::Simple). Fixed
the POD errors it found, too. [David]

=item *

Test suite now runs all tests with warnings enabled. [David]

=item *

Modified C<< Grp->get_objects() >> to use use the C<grp_id> parameter to
C<list()>, now that support for that parameter has been added to all groupable
classes. Also went through all existing code to make sure that it uses this
approach, rather than constructing the relevant objects one-at-a-time from
each Member object. This should provide a dramatic speedup in many
operations.

=item *

Bric::App::Session now has an C<instance()> public class method to return the
current C<%session> hash. [Scott]

=item *

Subelements can now nest. That is, they can contain themselves. Not in a story,
of course, but in the document model (element administration). [David]

=item *

Keywords can now be associated with media assets. [David]

=item *

Templates now have a C<published_version> attribute that properly reflects the
version of a template that was last deployed. This matches what Story and
Media have done since around version 1.3.2, and eliminates some warnings from
the error log. The UI has also been updated to properly show the deploy status
of templates. [David]

The installer should now properly detect that the Apache "log_config" module
is installed even when it's called "config_log". Thanks to Ilia Chipitsine for

Fixed asset class date parameters to list(). The asset classes were neglecting
to change the dates passed in to list() to database dates before querying the
database. This lead to the wrong stories being returned for everyone not using
UTC as their local time zone. Thanks to Bill Cappel for the spot! [David]

=item *

Fixed bug where expired cookie resulted in a Bric::App::Session

A number of default groups where not properly added to the "All Groups"

Bricolage now does more to determine the media type of uploaded media by using
both the Apache media type determination and, failing that, a file name
extension. Thanks to Todd Tyree for the spot. [David]

=item *

Fixed the description of the root category in the permissions profile for user
groups so that it properly displays its URI instead of its name. This only
affects the display of the root category in the permissions profile for people
who installed (rather than upgraded to) Bricolage 1.4.5 or later. [David]

An attempt to create a template with the same name and output channel as a
deactivated template now properly tells the user that the template already
exists. [David]

Fixed problem creating new business assets with SOAP where Bricolage was
trying to associate them with output channels twice, resulting in an SQL
Error. [David]

=item *

Fixed broken index on media type extensions. It was duplicating the index on
the media type names. It has been changed to uniquely index the media type
file name extensions. [David]

=item *

C<< Bric::Biz::Category->get_children >> now properly returns the children for
the root category. Thanks to Sam for the spot! [David]

=item *

Removed C<< Bric::Biz::AssetType->remove >>. It shouldn't be used anywhere,
and might be responsible for the mysterious disappearance of elements in
general. Thanks to JoE<atilde>o Pedro for the spot. [David]

=item *

Assigned appropriate permissions to allow the default "Story Editors," "Media
Producers," and "Template Developers" to access the default workflow and desks
relevant to them. They hadn't had that access by default before. [David]

=item *

Changed the plural name of the "Category Group" class from "Category Group" to
"Category Groups". [David]

=item *

Fixed bug introduced in 1.5.0 where stories where checked for duplicate URIs
for output channels that they weren't actually in. Thanks to Bill Cappel for
the spot. [David]

=item *

Fixed duplicate URI checking for media assets so that all output channels a
media asset is in will be checked for duplicate URIs instead of just the
primary URI. [David]

=item *

Fixed bug where all sources were being deactivated from their groups every
time they were saved. [David]

=item *

Fixed bug where the SOAP server would throw an exception when it attempted to
handle elements without subelements. Thanks to Sam Tregar for the report.
[David]

=item *

It is no longer possible to create a story type or media type element without
a primary output channel. [David]

=item *

Deleted output channels no longer show up in the list of output channels to
associate with a destination. Thanks to Alex Epshteyn for the spot! [David]

=item *

The installer now collects Apache configuration data from any C<Include>d
files, as well. Thanks to Alex Wheeler for the spot! [David]

=item *

Media types now can be added to groups. This means that permissions can be set
so that users can administer media types. Previously, only members of the
"Global Admins" group could administer media types. [David]

=head1 Version 1.5.0 (2003-01-09)

=head2 New Features

=over

=item *

Added unit testing framework based on L<Test::Class|Test::Class> and executed
by L<Test::Harness|Test::Harness>. Tests can be run after C<make install> by
running C<make test> or C<make devtest>. The former runs tests that access
database data but execute no C<INSERT>, C<UPDATE>, or C<DELETE> commands. The
latter runs tests that can make changes to the database, and are intended to be
a full testing of Bricolage's API. Both make targets can be executed in
verbose mode by passing C<TEST_VERBOSE=1> to the make command. From now on,
all tests will be expected to pass before changes are committed to the
repository. [David]

=item *

Added F<Makefile.PL>. This is mainly a dummy script designed to mimic the
usual way in which Perl modules are installed. It doesn't actually create a
F<Makefile>, but processes the existing one, setting it up to use whatever
Perl was used to execute F<Makefile.PL> itself. The advantage to this is that
the Perl that executes F<Makefile.PL> will be used throughout Bricolage. [David]

=item *

Migrated tests in F<lib/Bric/Util/Grp.pl> to F<t/lib/Bric/Util/Grp/Test.pm>
and F<t/lib/Bric/Util/Grp/DevTest.pm>. [David]

=item *

Added F<t/Bric/Test/PodTest.pm>, which uses L<Pod::Checker|Pod::Checker> to
examine the POD in all the Bricolage modules, scripts, and test modules and
report errors. Currently, all the errors are "TODO" tests, which means that,
technically, they'll pass. But as soon as all existing POD errors are cleaned
out, errors will turn into test failures. This will help us to keep all of our
POD valid. These tests run as a part of C<make devtest>. [David]

=item *

Removed all old-style test scripts. Their contents have been copied into new
unit testing classes. These classes each execute a single test, and the old
testing contents are at the end of the file, after the C<__END__> symbol. Thus
we'll be able to use the old tests to write the new tests. [David]

=item *

Added documentation on merging CVS branches to
L<Bric::Hacker|Bric::Hacker>. [David]

=item *

Removed the URI Format and URI Case preferences and put them into Output
Channel objects, instead. They are now output channel-specific. [David]

=item *

URI format and URI case settings now properly format the URIs of media
objects, too. [David]

=item *

The slug can now be used in the Fixed URI Format. [David]

=item *

The slug can now be used for story file names. The option is supported on an
output channel basis, and will only work for stories that have a slug. [David]

=item *

Added a "and Shelve" option to the "Check In" select list in the button bar on
story, media, and asset pages. When this option is selected, the asset is
checked in and then removed from workflow without publishing. [David]

=item *

Removed the "Checkin/Publish" and "Checkin/Deploy" buttons in asset profiles
and replaced them with new "and Publish" or "and Deploy" options in the "Check
In" select list in the button bar. Doing this collects all the usual Check In
actions in one place and saves us screen real estate! [David]

=item *

Changed the way the "Checkin and Publish" and "Checkin and Deploy" callbacks
work to use existing code in the desk and publish widgets to do the dirty
work. This greatly reduces code duplication. [David]

=item *

Created a new class,
L<Bric::Biz::OutputChannel::Element|Bric::Biz::OutputChannel::Element>, which
is a subclass of L<Bric::Biz::OutputChannel|Bric::Biz::OutputChannel>. This
new class better manages the mapping of output channels to elements than the
old approach did. It also adds a new property, C<enabled>, which will be put
to use shortly. [David]

=item *

Replaced all the custom handling of output channel objects in
L<Bric::Biz::AssetType|Bric::Biz::AssetType> with a new
L<Bric::Util::Coll|Bric::Util::Coll> subclass that does it all. This is a lot
more efficient in terms of programmer time (and probably performance,
too). [David]

=item *

Modified Bric::Biz::Asset::Business to manage the association between business
assets and output channels by making use of the
Bric::Util::Coll::OutputChannel class. It also automatically adds all of the
"enabled" output channels of the element object as initial output channel
associations for new business assets. [David]

=item *

Added a new property to templates: template types. This property can have one
of three value that correspond to different template types: "Element
Templates" (those associated with elements); Category Templates" (autohandlers
in Mason parlance, category templates to HTML::Template users, and until now
"generic templates" in the UI); and "Utility Templates" (those not associated
with anything, but can be used as includes). [David]

=item *

Templates are now guaranteed to have unique file name/output channel
combinations at the API and database levels. [David]

=item *

For stories on My Workspace, replaced "Trail" with "Clone". Clicking this link
will make an exact copy of the story with the words "Clone of " prepended to
the story title. [David]

=item *

Got rid of the popup window. Now when the toolbar-less window isn't the
current window, the browser will be redirected to a a Welcome page where users
can click a link to open the new window with the Bricolage UI. [David]

=item *

Improved the interface for the association of output channels in Element
Profile. It now uses a list of output channels rather than a double list, and
a radio button to select the primary output channel. Also, each associated
output channel can be marked as "Enabled" or not, indicating whether a new
asset based on the element will by default be associated with that output
channel for publishing. [David]

=item *

On a related note, Stories and Media can now select which output channels to
be published to on a per-story basis as well as which is the primary output
channel, and the selection sticks with each version of a an asset. The list of
available output channels comes from the output channels associated with the
element on which the story or media asset is based. [David]

=item *

Bric::Util::Burner objects have a new property, C<mode>. This property
contains an integer value indicating whether a burner object is currently
publishing, previewing, or checking syntax. The value maps to the
conveniently-named constants "PUBLISH_MODE", "PREVIEW_MODE", and
"SYNTAX_MODE". [David]

=item *

The documentation in the Bric::Util::Burner class has been updated and
improved. [David]

=item *

Arguments can now be passed to the C<display_pages()>, C<display_element()>,
and C<chain_next()> methods of the C<$burner> object in Mason templates. These
arguments are passed to the templates that are executed just as they are if
you'd called C<< $m->comp >>, meaning that you can access their values via the
C<%ARGS> global and in C<< <%args> >> blocks in Mason templates. [David]

=item *

Changed the C<display_pages()> method of Bric::Util::Burner::Mason so that its
first argument can be an anonymous array of the names of different paginated
elements, and then all of those different paginated elements will be burned in
order. This allows a story to have more than one type of paginated
element. [David]

=item *

Added the methods C<prev_page_file()>, C<prev_page_uri()>,
C<next_page_file()>, and C<next_page_uri()> to Bric::Util::Burner. These
methods return the strings representing the file names or URIs of the previous
and next pages of a story, relative to the page that is currently being
burned and, in the case of the C<*_uri()> methods, appropriate to the
currently-burning Output Channel. Also updated the
L<Bric::Templates|Bric::Templates> and
L<Bric::AdvTemplates|Bric::AdvTemplates> documents to reflect these
additions. [David]

=item *

Added C<source__id> to list of criteria by which stories can be searched via
the Bric::Biz::Asset::Business::Story C<list()> and C<list_ids()>
methods. [David]

=item *

The Bricolage CSS document is now a static file served by Apache rather than a
Mason component processed by mod_perl. This allows the style sheet to be
cached by the browser so that it doesn't have to request it for every page in
Bricolage. It also cuts down on processing time, since it doesn't have to be
managed dynamically as a Mason component anymore. Also, all font sizes are now
specified in pixels instead of points, in order to maximize the consistency of
cross-browser font rendering. [David]

=item *

Added a new style for the template profile, so that template code is now
displayed in its textarea box in a monospaced font. [David]

=item *

The main Bricolage JavaScript library has had several other JavaScript
libraries rolled into it, and is now a static file served by Apache rather
than a Mason component processed by mod_perl. This allows the JS to be cached
by the browser so that it doesn't have to request it for every page in
Bricolage. It also cuts down on processing time, since it doesn't have to be
managed dynamically as a Mason component anymore. [David]

=item *

Added F<bricolage.conf> directive "ALLOW_WORKFLOW_TRANSFER" to allow assets on
shared desks to be able to be transferred across workflows via that shared
desk. [David]

=item *

Changed Bric::Util::Burner to set C<publish_status> after publishing, rather
than before. Thus it is only set if the publish is successful, while at the
same time templates can check C<publish_status> to determine if a story is
being published for the first time. [David]

=item *

Added C<get_more_pages()> method to Bric::Util::Burner::Mason. It returns true
if more pages remain to be burned, and false if not. However it's only
enumerated when C<display_pages()> is being used to output pages. [David]

=item *

Optimized Bric::Biz::Category to get a list of Group IDs for each category as
it is selected from the database. This prevents the C<get_grp_ids()> method
from having to query the database, which was happening for every category
object for which permissions are checked. [Mark & David]

=item *

Added event logging for keywords. [David]

=item *

Changed the code in Bric::Util::Burner::Mason to allow for new Mason burners
to be constructed and used to publish stories from within templates. This is
useful for generating tables of contents and such. [David]

=item *

Added support for the association between business assets and output channels
to the SOAP interface. [David]

=item *

Removed IO::String dependence. [Scott]

=item *

Added a FAQ. [Scott]

=item *

Added a preference for naming the Bricolage instance. [Scott]

=item *

Added search by Category URI to Find Stories. Although one could use the
search by URI feature for this before, it didn't allow for search by secondary
categories. Now stories can be searched for in both primary and secondary
categories. [David]

=item *

Added the methods C<page_file()> and C<page_uri()> to Bric::Util::Burner. When
passed a page number argument, these methods return the strings representing
the file names or URIs of the given page in the currently-burning story and, in
the case of the C<page_uri()> method, appropriate to the currently-burning
Output Channel. These methods are best used in burners that don't burn one
page at a time, such as Burner::Template. [David]

=item *

Ported to HTML::Mason versions 1.15 and higher. [Scott]

=item *

Added C<make uninstall> support to installation system. [Scott]

=item *

Added C<page_filepath()> method to Bric::Util::Burner. This method allows
burner subclasses to get the name of a file to write to the file system
without needing to figure out the file name themselves. [David]

=item *

Optimized behavior of collections (internal API). Now when an object is
deleted from a collection (for example, when a member is deleted from a
group), all the existing objects in the collection won't first be looked up in
the database. The upshot is that certain parts of Bricolage that rely on
collections, such as desks, should be more responsive. [David]

=head1 Version 1.4.6 (2003-01-06)

=head2 Bug Fixes

=over

=item *

Bric::SAOP::Handler now properly logs fatal errors that are strings rather than
exceptions. [David]

=item *

Updated Bric::DBA documentation to better reflect PostgreSQL standards.
[Neil Conway]

=item *

Minor documentation correction in Bric::Util::Grp::Parts::Member. [Mark]

=item *

Fixed bug in SOAP interface where container subelements added to a story or
media asset were logged as if the story type element or media type element was
added instead of the appropriate subelement. [David]

=item *

Fixed bug in publish code that was attempting to use the Apache request object
as a media asset. Thanks to John Greene for the spot. [David]

=item *

Fixed bug where an empty or non-numeric <size> element in an imported
media object would cause an SQL error. [Sam]

=item *

The F<bric_apachectl>, F<bric_clean_tmp>, F<bric_dist_mon>, and F<bric_ftpd>
scripts are now smarter about loading Bricolage libraries and reporting
relevant errors when they can't load Bricolage libraries. Thanks to Geoff
Richards for the patch. [David]

=item *

Category permissions are now properly checked on assets when they're not in
workflow as well as when they are in workflow. This means that if a group of
users is granted permission to access stories in a category, they can now
access those stories even if they're not in workflow. [David]

=item *

The search interface for locating media and story assets to relate to a story
now checks the permissions of the assets found and only displays the assets
for which the user has at least READ permission. Thanks to Sean Greathouse for
the spot. [David]

=item *

Reverting a media asset now properly reverts the media file itself, as well.
[David]

=item *

The "Last" field is now properly highlighted as the default order field when
displaying a list of contributors in the Contributor Manager. [David]

=item *

Contributor Association now includes search options and only
currently-associated contributors are displayed before searching. [David]

=item *

The ability to select different fields by which to sort a list of objects now
works again. [David]

=item *

The installer now checks to make sure that mod_perl is statically compiled
into Apache, since weird things tend to happen when Bricolage uses a DSO
mod_perl. [David]

=item *

Fixed reordering code for subelements. The select list for subelements should
now always have an appropriate value. [David]

=item *

The URI is now properly updated in media assets when some part of the URI is
changed in the UI. Thanks to Sean Greathouse for the spot. [David]

=item *

The Add More widget no longer throws an exception when "Add More" is clicked
and only one field currently exists. This had affected Keywords entry in
stories. Thanks to Sam for the spot. [David]

=item *

Fixed bug where a user could create two assets with the same URI as long as
they were both checked out by that user. Thanks to Shannon Brown for the spot!
[David]

=item *

Date fields can now be unset. That is, if each of the select fields is set to
its label, rather than a value, it'll stay that way. This was first noticed
with the "Expire Date" in stories. Thanks to Philip Fibiger for the spot.
[David]

=item *

Modified installation C<CREATE DATABASE> command to always create the database
with the encoding set to UTF-8 (UNICODE). [David]

=item *

Added instructions for installing readline library to README.MacOSX. [David]

=item *

Added "Order" and "OrderDirection" parameters to C<< Bric::Util::Grp->list >>
in order to be able to specify a different column and sort order for getting a
list of groups. [David]

=item *

Improved error handling by the SOAP server. Full errors will now be printed to

escaped, and all database transactions for a single request will be rolled
back in the event of an error. [David]

=back

=head2 Bug Fixes

=over

=item *

Fixed error message generated from Bric::SOAP::Template->update() to
properly display the category name, rather than "ARRAY(0x9cf43bc)". [Sam]

=item *

The Bricolage SOAP interface will no longer allow the creation of
stories and media with duplicate URIs. [Sam]

=item *

Fixed circular dependency issues when Bricolage modules are used in the
C<PERL_LOADER> F<bricolage.conf> directive. [David]

=item *

Added the root category to the "All Categories" group. It should have been in
that group all along. [David]

=item *

Documentation for C<< Bric::Biz::Workflow->list >> has been improved, and the
method used for finding workflows and desks to put imported assets on in
Bric::SOAP has been simplified. [David]

=item *

Added printing of a message regarding the filenames being processed by
F<bric_soap>'s C<create> and C<update> commands when its C<--verbose> option
is set. [David]

=item *

Setting a story's cover date to a date that causes one of its URIs to conflict
with an existing story's URIs no longer causes an error. Thanks to Sam for the
spot! [David]

=item *

Display of the source was missing from the view Story and Media profiles, but
no longer. [David]

=item *

The correct source is now displayed in the Story and Media edit profiles.
[David]

=item *

An attempt to install Bricolage to use an existing PostgreSQL user no longer
causes an installation error when you decline drop the user. [David]

=item *

The burner no longer fails when it publishes an asset that's not on a
desk. [David]

=item *

SOAP now does the proper thing when deleting assets, removing them from desks
and workflow only if they're on desks and in workflow. [David]

=item *

Added support for the missing C<publish_status> parameter to
C<< Bric::Biz::Asset::Business::Media->list >>. [David]

=item *

Setting permissions on the assets in a category works again. [David]

=item *

Fixed a bug where exporting a story via SOAP containing a date field
would output the formatted date rather than the expected ISO 8601
format.  Systems with a modified date format pref would then refuse to
accept the story on import, producing an "Unable to unpack date"
error. [Sam]

=item *

Stories, media, and templates created but not saved no longer disappear into
the void. They are instead moved into workflow, put on a desk, and saved as
soon as they were created. [David]

=item *

Permissions are now properly checked for category and workflow settings when
new stories, media, and template assets are created. [David]

=item *

New templates are now active by default. [David]

=item *

Fixed bug where the "Checkin/Publish" (and "Checkin/Deploy") button wasn't
provided to users who had EDIT access to a the assets on a desk. Permissions
are now properly checked and the button displayed for those who can publish
from a desk. [David]

=item *

Added missing debugging statement to Bric::Util::DBI. Thanks to Mark for the
spot. [David]

=item *

The SOAP interface now properly logs events for its activities. [David]

=item *

Previewing a story while searching for a related story to link to an element
no longer replaces the Bricolage UI with the preview, as was happening with
some browsers. Instead, a separate preview window is opened. [David]

=item *

When publishing a media asset, its name will not be properly added to the UI
message, without causing an error. [Petar Bojkov]

=item *

Fixed exception class name in Handler.pm. [Scott]

Empty listManager lists no longer have a gap in them. [David]

=item *

Made the table around the formBuilder radio buttons prettier. [David]

=item *

Fixed numbering of sections in Media profile so that the numbers don't

=item *

Updated display of existing contributors in the "Edit Contributors" screen of
the story and media asset profiles to use listManager. This makes them look

Removed code and documentation for PostgreSQL 7.3 compatibility. With the
release of 7.3b2, it's no longer needed. [David]

=item *

Fixed "make clone" to properly include database contents in clone
distribution. [Sam]

=item *

Added C<< <meta http-equiv="Content-Type"> >> tag to the C<< <head> >> to
F<header.mc> so that the browser knows to send text back to Bricolage in the
expected character set. [Mark]

=item *

Changed the default character set from ISO-8859-1 to UTF-8. With this setting,
Bricolage does no character set translation, so it's faster. Furthermore, most
users I<should> be outputting UTF-8 in their templates, anyway. If you're not,
then you're likely finding doing charset translation in all of your templates
to be a big PITA. And if you're not doing charset translation, then you really
I<are> outputting UTF-8 in your templates, and just haven't realized it.
[David]

=item *

Fixed bug when reverting stories and media with no associated contributors.
[Mark]

=item *

"Check In and Publish" now works again for Media assets. Thanks to Matt Vella
for the spot. [David]

=item *

Deleting assets on My Workspace now prompts the user to make sure s/he really
wants to do that. Not sure how we missed this all this time! Thanks to Andrew
Baio for the spot. [David]

=item *

Assets on Desks and My Workspace that are checked out to the the user whose
viewing them will now always preview the version as currently edited by the
user, rather than the last checked-in version. Other users still can only
preview the last checked-in version. [David]

=item *

Clicking the "Check In" or "Check In/Deploy" buttons in a template profile now
properly updates the template with any new data entered into the template
profile before attempting a syntax check. This ensures that the latest data
you've entered gets its syntax checked before the template is checked in or
deployed. [David]

=item *

Fixed a bug in Bric::Util::Class where classes couldn't be looked up by
package name. This affected the "Access Denied" page. [David]

=item *

Made Bric::Util::Burner::Mason a little smarter handling exceptions. [David]

Fixed bug in C<< Bric::Util::Grp->has_member >> where an already-added member

Fixed bug where selecting a large number of list options in the story profile
would cause an SQL error. [Matt]

=item *

Fixed bug where Bric::SOAP would accept story element types for media and vice
versa. Thanks to Evan Prodromou for the spot. [Sam]

Added code to installation scripts to delete existing Mason object files when
upgrading. This hasn't been a problem thus far, but this step will help to
ensure that users are always running the latest UI components. [David]

The root category ("/") no longer returns itself as its own parent. [David]

=item *

Assets not in workflow are now properly logged as being checked out when
someone checks them out. [David]

=item *

The "Or Pick a Type" menus in the Group manager, the Contributor manager, and
the Element manager all work again. [David]

=item *

Changing category names now updates the name of the category asset group
object, which appears in the user group permissions page. [David]

=item *

Hitting the "enter" key after filling in a search field now properly submits
the search as if the "Search" button had been clicked. [David]

=item *

Changed libapreq requirement in Bric::Admin to read "Apache::Request
1.0". This should make the installer install the most recent version of
libapreq, instead of relying on whatever the OS provides. [David]

=item *

Changed value of autopopulated media asset data fields to an empty string when
the value returned by the autopopulation method is C<undef>. [David]

=item *

Fixed bug where autopopulated media asset data fields weren't properly
autopopulated. [David]

=item *

Fixed problem with category upgrade script failing on category data
created with 1.3.2. [Sam]

=item *

During installation, entering a directory name when prompted for the "PID File
Location" now results in Bricolage using a file called "httpd.pid" in that
directory, rather than trying (and failing) to use the directory itself as the
PID file. [David]

=item *

The side navigation layer is now better aware of its context, and changes the
colors of some of its graphics depending on the context. Also recreated the
"WORKFLOW" tab graphics. It looks like this has been broken for over a year,
and I only just noticed it! [David]

=item *

Slightly improved handling of assets that have forgotten where they
are. [David]

=item *

Checked-out templates are now displayed only once (instead of twice) in the
"Find Templates" manager. [David]

=item *

Added C<get_new_objs()> method to Bric::Util::Coll so that Bric::Util::Grp's
C<has_member()> method can see a member even if it hasn't been saved to the
database. Also changed Bric::Util::Grp to check for members in this way, of
course. [David]

=item *

Assets retrieved from the library now appear on the desk they're checked out
into only once (instead of twice). This thanks to the above-noted changes to
Bric::Util::Grp. [David]

=item *

Added upgrade script F<inst/upgrade/1.4.1/clean_desks.pl> to clean up existing
duplicate listings of assets on desks. [David]

=item *

Removed the C<checkin()> method from Bric::Biz::Asset::Template and
Bric::Biz::Asset::Business and put it into Bric::Biz::Asset, instead, since
it's exactly the same for all assets. [David]

=item *

Fixed the display of permissions settings to be more consistent with the
design and layout of the rest of the application. Also neatened listManager
display a bit. [David]

=item *

Fixed misnamed database constraint. [David]

=item *

Templates can once again be retrieved from the library and checked out for
revising. [David]

=item *

Assets on a desk now no longer have the current desk listed in the "Move to"
select list. Even if they did, selecting the current desk would no longer
remove an asset from workflow! Thanks to Andrew Baio for the spot. [David]

=item *

The installer is now much more intelligent about prompting for SSL
information. It won't ask if you want to use SSL if it can't find mod_ssl or
apache_ssl, and will only prompt you to pick one or the other if it can find
both. [David]

=item *

Added README.MacOSX. [David]

=item *

You can now pass a date format string argument to the C<get_data()> method of
container elements in templates (and elsewhere, for that matter). This is

Assets are now properly removed from desks when they are published or moved
from one desk to another. More generally, any time a single object is removed
from a group, it will be properly removed. [David]

=item *

Media profile now display the proper category in the Category select
list. [David]

=item *

Media assets with no associated media file now generate a message indicating
that no file will be distributed, and are properly removed from workflow when
published. [David]

=item *

Some media asset events weren't getting logged properly Now they are. [David]

=item *

Database transactions are now properly maintained when publishing
assets. Everything was working, but DBI C<AutoCommit> was getting turned on,
and this likely slowed some things down a bit. [David]

=item *

Assets can once again be found via the "Find" pages and recalled into a
workflow without error. [David]

=item *

Module man pages are now properly installed under Perl 5.8.0. Thanks to
Michael Schwern for helping to diagnose the problem and come up with a

The select list of desks to transfer an asset to on My Workspace now includes
all possible desks, including the one for which there is a link. [JoE<atilde>o

All Bricolage F<.pod> files are now installed and converted to C<man> pages
along with all of the F<.pm> files. [David]

=item *

Corrected a bunch of spelling errors in this file. [David]

=item *

Calling C<get_data()> on a container element in templates (or elsewhere, for
that matter) now properly ignores container subelements. Likewise for
C<get_container()>, which how properly ignores data subelements. [David]

=item *

All of the F<.pl> and F<.tst> files in F<lib/> no longer clutter up the
distribution created by C<make dist>. [David]

=item *

Much of the POD documentation in the API classes has been cleaned up, and
converting them to man pages no longer generates any error messages. [David]

The install process will now find Apache modules in
/usr/lib/apache/modules, which is where they are in OpenBSD. Thanks to
Mark Johnson for his help tracking this one down.  [Sam]

=head1 Version 1.3.3 (2002-08-24)

=head2 New Features

=over

=item *

Revised Bric::Biz::Keyword implementation to improve performance. The new
implementation no longer relies on the Bric::Util::Grp system. Also
implemented API and database support for Media keywords. [Sam]

=item *

Added support for search Media by category and file name through the SOAP
interface and standard API. [Sam]

=item *

Added new C<--save-cookie-file> and C<--use-cookie-file> options to
F<bric_soap> to allow authentication to span F<bric_soap> calls. This can
result in significant time savings across multiple invocations. [Matt]

=item *

Added new C<--chunks> option to the F<bric_soap> tool to avoid problems with
timeouts on large workloads. Currently only supports the workflow commands
(C<publish>, C<deploy>, C<checkin>, C<checkout>, C<move>), but it will be
expanded to other long-running commands in the future. [Sam]

=item *

Improved performance of search paging. ListManager now only builds the output
rows that will actually be shown on the screen. For large data sets this
results in a huge gain in search speed. [Adam and Sam]

=item *

Revised category implementation to use explicit C<uri> and C<parent_id> fields
rather than relying on the Bric::Util::Grp system. This improves performance
tremendously for larger numbers of categories. [Jeff Pinyan]

=item *

Added new C<--continue-on-errors> option to F<bric_soap> to prevent non-fatal
errors from ending the process. [Sam]

=item *

Beautified the list paging interface. [David]

=item *

Added new Media Type manager. [Scott]

=item *

Added list reverse feature. [Scott]

=item *

Added SFTP mover. [Scott]

=item *

Add support for Apache-SSL. This required a change to the context of the
F<bricolage.conf> C<ENABLE_SSL> directive to indicate the type of SSL support:
none, apache_ssl, or mod_ssl. [Michael Robinton]

=item *

Added support for manual httpd configuration. Split out dynamic configuration
from ApacheConfig.pm and move to a new module, ApacheStartup.pm, that sets no
Apache configuration directives. ApacheConfig.pm calls this module. [Michael
Robinton]

=item *

Added F<bricolage.conf> configuration directive to force the start up process
to always write out a F<C<$TEMP_DIR>/bricolage/bric_httpd.conf> as an
F<httpd.conf> include file. [Michael Robinton]

=item *

Moved SSL key and certificate configuration from global F<httpd.conf> settings
to per virtual host via F<bricolage.conf> configuration directives. [Michael
Robinton]

=item *

Added a C<bricolage.conf> directive to force the user to always use SSL.
[Michael Robinton]

=item *

Added C<get_data()> method to Bric::Util::Grp::Parts::Member::Contrib. This
method takes a simpler scalar argument and returns the relevant attribute.
This bit of syntactic sugar makes contributor objects behave a bit more like
C<$element> objects in templates, thus simplifying things for template
developers. [David]

=item *

Categories now default to sorting by URI, and the URI is the searchable field,
rather than name. [David]

=item *

Vastly improved the speed at which categories can be imported via SOAP.
[David]

=item *

Makefile now confirms location of Apache and PostgreSQL to allow for
systems with multiple versions of each available. [Sam]

=item *

Added "make clone" command to the installation system to create
distributions based on existing Bricolage systems.  [Sam]

=item *

Added F<bricolage.conf> directive to enable/disable the browser toolbar for
debugging and development. Documented in L<Bric::Hacker|Bric::Hacker>.
[Michael Robinton]

=item *

Added support for running Bricolage with SSL support on arbitrary ports.
Previous versions required https support to use only port 80 for http and port
443 for https. With this release, Bricolage fully supports http and https
service on any ports. This allows the Apache daemon supporting Bricolage to be
run with a minimum number of children while still allowing normal http and
https service on the standard ports with a light-weight Apache daemon. See the
F<INSTALL> file (or L<Bric::Admin|Bric::Admin>) for full details and an
example installation procedure. [Michael Robinton]

=item *

Added new F<bric_apachectl> command "single". This command will start
Bricolage in single-process mode. This mode is principally useful for
debugging. [Michael Robinton]

=item *

The size of the database column that stores custom field options (such as for
select lists) has been changed to the TEXT PostgreSQL type, so that the number
of options isn't arbitrarily limited. [Matt Vella]

=item *

The group API has been approximately 75% rewritten. The goal was to optimize
its performance, since group activity proved to be a serious bottleneck to
Bricolage performance. Those interested in the nitty-gritty details of the
rewrite can read about them
L<here|http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=967943&forum_id=561>.

Fixed bug where installation system would chown all of the chosen TEMP_DIR to
SYS_USER. Thanks to Dave Rolsky for the report. [Sam]

Fixed a bug in the installation system that was creating empty comp/comp and
data/data directories BRICOLAGE_ROOT. Thanks to Michael for the spot. [Sam]

Fixed remote previews to redirect to a better URL. [Mark]

=item *

Fixed a bug where trying to create a story through the SOAP interface
containing a contributor with an empty middle name would fail.  [Sam]

=item *

Changed strftime instances of '%G' to '%Y' in URI preference, as this seems to
be more portable. [David]

Fixed bug that was preventing 'make upgrade' from running database upgrade
scripts. [Sam]

Fixed broken "Log" link on Media Search results screen. [Sam]

=item *

Fixed bug where deleted output channels were showing up in list of available
output channels in the element profile. [David]

Fixed conflict in list manager that prevented some lists from working

Media Type manager. Thanks to Scott for the heads-up. [David]

The C<PREVIEW_MASON> configuration directive no longer is no longer defaulting
to on in one context and off in another. It is now off by default. Thanks to
Michael Slattery for the spot! [David]

Eliminated the password field type from the formBuilder interface used for
contributor types and elements. Its inclusion up to now may be considered a
bug. [David]

=item *

Fixed cover date editing to repopulate correctly on the Story profile screens.
[Matt]

=item *

Fixed bug where previewing a story assigned to multiple categories would
preview to a random category. Now the primary category is always chosen. [Sam]

=item *

Fixed display and editing of dates more than one year in the past. [Matt]

=item *

Fixed bug where setting CHAR_SET to UTF-8 in bricolage.conf would result in
blank output. [Sam]

=item *

Changed Category manager to display no categories by default, only display
them after a search. This is because some folks have a I<lot> of categories.
[David]

=item *

Fixed bug where when C<SYS_USER> and/or C<SYS_GROUP> wasn't in
F<bricolage.conf>, Bric::Config would use the username "nobody" instead of the
UID for the user "nobody". [David]

=item *

Adding a note to a story that has not yet been saved no longer causes an
error. [David]

=item *

Fixed "make dist" to work on Mac OS/X and FreeBSD. [Sam]

=item *

Fixed a problem in Bric::Util::Burner::Template where a newly added
template wouldn't be picked up by <tmpl_include>.  This was due to
caching being turned on.  HTML::Template's cache doesn't know that a
new compilation would turn up a difference <tmpl_include> so it
continues to use the old one.  [Sam]

=item *

Fixed installer to not require unneeded Apache modules (mod_proxy and
mod_rewrite). [Sam]

=item *

Fixed installer to first ask whether SSL support is desired before asking for a
specific SSL module. [Sam]

=item *

Fixed documentation bug in Bric::Admin concerning PostgreSQL paths. Thanks to
Vicki Brown for the catch. [Sam]

Fixed installation system to fail if there are errors importing the database.
Also added test for missing or empty bricolage.sql. [Sam]

=item *

Fixed installation system to support optional modules and not force users to
install them. [Sam]

Fixed bug that prevented the contents of fields to be updated through
Bric::SOAP. [Sam]

=item *

Fixed "Checkin and Publish" button to only appear if the user has permissions
to publish. [Matt]

Fixed bug where text pasted into Bulk Edit textarea box was getting words
smooshed together. Thanks to Rachel Murray for the spot. [David]

=item *

Fixed bug where date field elements weren't getting properly converted between
the local time zone and UTC, which is the time zone of all the dates in the
database. Thanks to Matt Vella for the spot. [David]

=item *

Fixed issue where Bric::Util::Grp was adding every member of a group whenever
a new member was added. This was very wasteful, and slowed performance a great
deal for groups with thousands of members. Thanks to Mark for the spot.
[David]

=item *

Added check for Category "Directory" string to make sure that no non-URL
characters are added. [Matt Vella]

=item *

Clicking "Cancel" when editing keywords in a new story now properly returns to
the story profile, rather than to the last screen before the story was

This is useful to avoid timing out on long runs. [Sam]

=item *

Added [Check In / Publish] button to Story Profile to checkin and
publish in one step. [Matt]

=item *

Added needs_publish() method and associated published_version database
field to Bric::Biz::Asset.  This method is now used by the publisher
to determine if something needs republishing.  Added new graphics to
display this information on the desks.  [Matt]

=item *

Moved repeated publish and preview functionality into
Bric::Util::Burner.  Updated Mason code and Bric::SOAP::Workflow
accordingly.  [Matt]

Fixed bug in Bric::SOAP::Element where deleting an element or field

The Bric::Biz::Category class method get_attr() now returns attributes for
category ID 0 as well as all other categories. [JoE<atilde>o Pedro

Fixed bug in DBI_DEBUG and DBI_CALL_TRACE options where non-prepared queries
(row_aref(), all_aref(), etc.) were not being logged. [Sam]

=item *

Fixed bug in Bric::Dist::Resource that was causing publish to run very
slowly by executing a bad database query. [Sam]

=item *

Related to the last item, fixed a bug in Bric::Util::Coll that would call
the href() method on a class and pass in undefined values as parameters.
This will happen if a collection is created for a new object that does not
yet have an ID. The fix thus prevents the "= NULL" SQL syntax, which always
matches nothing. The new syntax for constructing a collection has been
implemented across the API. [David]

=item *

Fixed bug where the root category wasn't able to be added to a category
group. Actually, this fixes a problem where any object with an id of 0
couldn't be added to a group. Thanks to Mark for the spot. [David]

=item *

Changed mover list to be sorted in alphabetical order in the Destination
profile. This has the benefit of forcing "FTP" to be listed before "File
System" -- Hurray for case-sensitive ordering! Thanks to Sam for the
complaint. [David]

=item *

The OS for a destination server now defaults to the OS of the server on
which Bricolage is installed instead of "Mac". Thanks to Sam for the spot.
[David]

=item *

Deleted destinations will now be dissociated from output channels when
they're deleted. This prevents stories from being published to deleted
destinations. Thanks to Mark for the heads-up. [David]

=item *

Fixed bug where attribute metadata wasn't getting deleted when it was
supposed to. [JoE<atilde>o Pedro GonE<ccedil>alves]

=item *

Fixed bug where some browsers submit an image button with a value stored in
the image button's name as well as in the name with ".x" and ".y" appended
to it. This caused callbacks to be triggered twice for a single field! I
noticed this with Mozilla on Mac OS X, and presume it would happen
elsewhere, too. [David]

=item *

Fixed bug in navigation bar HTML that caused the bar to disappear on
certain browsers. [Rachel Murray]

=item *

Fixed bug in Bric::SOAP where Bricolage exceptions resulted in an
uninformative "Application error" message. Now the full exception message is
displayed. [Sam]

=item *

Fixed installation to work under Debian Linux 3.0 (testing). Thanks to Mark
Jaroski for a helpful patch. [Sam]

=item *

Changed length of Bric::Dist::Job name attribute from 64 characters to 256.
This allows long asset names to be used. Also added code to Bric::Dist::Job
to ensure that the name property is truncated if it's longer than 256
characters. Thanks to Josh Cox for the spot. [David]

=item *

Fixed bug where dumber browsers would submit a new template without any
Element selected. Thanks to Michael Robinton for reporting the bug. [David]

=item *

All stories and media are now required to be associated with a category. For
stories, the primary category cannot be deleted. If you want to change the
primary category, add a new category, change it to the primary, and then
delete the old primary category. This fix prevents previews and publishes
from breaking on stories and media that had no categories. Thanks to Mark for
the heads-up. [David]

An overhaul of the burn system had regressed the Output Channel preview
functionality. I've put it back now. [Mark]

be auto-populated (e.g., bit rate, frame size, length, encoding, etc.). [David]

=item *

Fixed bug where Categories with the same directory name could not be created.
Thanks to Andrew Baio for the spot. [David]

=item *

Fixed a bug where a user couldn't look at her own event log if she didn't have
permission. Thank to Michael Alan Dorman for the spot. [David]

=item *

Fixed a bug where permissions set to access workflows and desks had no affect on
the display of workflows and desks. Thanks to Rachel Murray for the spot.
[David]

=item *

Fixed bug where attempting to create a destination with the same name as an
existing but deactivated destination triggered an SQL error. Thanks to Michael
Alan Dorman for the spot. [David]

=item *

Fixed bug where Workflows with spaces in their names would not create proper
submenus in the left navigation bar. Thanks to the WHO for the spot [David]

=item *

Fixed bug where the wrong story might be previewed when clicking the title of a
story in My Workspace or on a desk. [David]

=item *

Changing the category a media asset is in now correctly updates the underlying
category object and the URI without the media asset needing to be checked in.
[Matt Vella]

=item *

Eliminated "Template compile failed" errors for templates with <%init> sections.
[David]

=item *

Field elements now show up with their display names in the bulk edit select
lists, instead of with their names (which are really keys). [David]

=item *

Eliminated "Use of uninitialized value in bitwise or (|)" warnings when checking
permissions. Thanks to Sam Tregar for the spot. [David]

=item *

Custom fields in elements and contributor types now remember their "size"
setting. Thanks to Sam Tregar for the spot. [David]

=item *

The Element select list on the new Template profile no longer lists media
elements, since media assets don't use templates. [David]

=item *

Removed old XML::Writer stuff from Bric::Util::Burner, since I moved it to
Bric::Util::Burner::Mason a while ago and it was causing some problems. Thanks
to Michael Robinton for the spot. [David]

=item *

Fixed typo in Bric::Hacker spotted by Axel Beckert. [Sam]

=item *

The CREATE permission works properly now. Thanks to Rachel Murray for the spot.

=head1 Version 1.2.1 (2002-02-25)

=head2 New Features

=over

=item *

Created new method of configuring Bricolage in Apache. For mod_perl 1.26 and
earlier, a custom config file will be written to the bricolage temp directory
every time Bricolage is started or restarted. For mod_perl 1.27 and later, no
temp file will be written. [David]

=item *

Added support for Mozilla (and there was much rejoicing!). [David]

=item *

Changed password for the default "admin" user to "change me now!" [David]

=item *

The slug is stored in the database for both fixed and non-fixed stories. This is
in anticipation of adding the ability to use the slug for fixed story URIs later
on. Thanks to Darren Graves for the patch.

=item *

Added DISABLE_NAV_LAYER directive. It's off by default, but if you turn it on in
bricolage.conf, the side navigation layer will be rendered as plain HTML in
every page instead of as a separate layer. [David]

=item *

Documented PERL_LOADER directive in Bric::AdvTemplates. [David]

=item *

Turned off the PREVIEW_MASON configuration directive in bricolage.conf. It should
be off by default. [David]

=item *

Deleted Output Channels now properly don't show up in the Output Channel manager
again. Thanks to Sara for the spot! [David]

=item *

All previews now preview assets in the primary Output Channel only. Previously,
the previews were in the Output Channel whose name came first alphabetically.
Thanks to Sara Wood for catching this bug. [David]

=item *

Fixed bug where templates often couldn't be found by the Mason burner if the
output channel had a post_path. [David]

=item *

Fixed bug where templates often couldn't be found by the HTML::Template burner

Fixed some problems with the sideNav menus under Netscape. [David]

=item *

Fixed broken "Preview" button in Read-only story profile and in related story
elements. [Matt Vella]

=item *

Updated debugging code to accommodate new syntax in Cache::Cache. Thanks to Sam
Tregar for the spot. [David]

=item *

Fixed problem with Element names containing non-alphanumeric characters. [Sam]

=item *

Checking out media assets from "Find Media" now redirects you to the media
profile if you've checked out one media asset, or My Workspace if you've checked
out more than one. This puts it in line with how "Find Stories" and "Find
Templates" work. Thanks to Sam for the report. [David]

=item *

Fixed bulk edit functionality for Media assets. Thanks to Sam for the spot.
[David]

=item *

In Bric::Biz::Asset::Business, the source get_meth key in my_meths() now works
properly. Also, get_all_keywords() now also returns the category keywords as
well as the story keywords. Thanks to Darren Graves for the patch.

=item *

Removed quotation marks from DEF_MEDIA_TYPE setting in F<bricolage.conf>.
Thanks to Darren Graves for the spot. [David]

=item *

Sorting assets by ID in "Find X" and Workspace/Desk view now properly does a
numeric sort rather than an alphanumeric sort. Thanks to Sam Tregar for the
spot. [David]

=item *

Fixed an obscure bug where, for files uploaded as part of a Media file,
Bricolage attempted to create a path on its own file system using path
delimiters for another file system. Thanks to Mike Slattery for the spot.
[David]

=item *

Required content fields in stories and elements are now displayed in the order
specified in the Element profile. Thanks to Sam Tregar for the spot. [David]

=item *

All assets now start with the version number 0 until the first time they are
checked in. Also, they will show up on desks and in the Find views after the
first time they are saved. It was inconsistent before, and some items could not
be seen in the desk and Find views until they were checked in. Thanks to Sam for
spotting the inconsistency. [David]

=item *

The bric_clean_tmp script has been changed to avoid deleting the Bricolage
cache file.  [Sam]

=item *

Fixed typo that broke Bric::Dist::Client. [Mike Slattery]

=item *

Fixed multiple select custom fields for Elements and Contributors. Thanks to
Mike Slattery for the spot. [David]

=item *

Fixed ugly bug where deleting a "Media Type" Element would delete all the media
objects of that type. Thanks to Sam for the spot (though not for the bug!).
[David]

=item *

Fixed bric_pgimport so that it uses DBI to drop and create the database, rather
than relying on a hard-coded location for pgsql binaries. [David]

=item *

Fixed permission granting in bric_pgimport so that the Bricolage database use
has DELETE permissions on all objects in the Bricolage database. It looks like
this permission was ignored in PostgreSQL 7.1 and earlier, or problems would have
shown up a long time ago! [David]

=item *

Fixed a bug where the time a distribution job is scheduled was not properly
converted to UTC for storage in the database. Thanks to Mike Slattery for the
great code archaeology! [David]

=item *

Fixed the spelling of "contributor" in several spots. [Andrew Baio]

=item *

Fixed bug where changing a story's primary category left it with B<no> primary
category. [Matt Vella]

=head1 Version 1.2.0 (2002-01-10)

=head2 New Features

=over

=item *

Added Context-sensitive, online help. [Sam]

=item *

Added separate interface for editing templates (via FTP). [Sam]

=item *

Added the ability to use HTML::Template Templates. [Sam]

=item *

Added ability for different Output Channels to function as different component
roots for in Mason templates. This will allow for templates that can't be found
in the current Output Channel to be searched for in other Output Channels.
[David]

=item *

Added link to Event log to Find Story, Find Template, and Find Media screens.
[David]

=item *

Added true previewing for media assets. Now, when you click their URIs to
preview them, they will be distributed to the preview server(s) before
redirecting the user to them, rather than just serving them up from where they
live on the Bricolage file system. The latter can still be accessed under
"Download" in the Media Asset profile. This will continue to be the preferred
way to grab media files for editing and such, as it will not incur the overhead
of distributing the media file. [David]

=item *

Allow only one template with a given name for a given category, element, burner
and output channel. [Sam]

=item *

Added a Maintainer section to the About page. [David]

=item *

Updated About page to mimic the layout of the help pages. [David]

=back

=head2 Bug Fixes

=over

=item *

Fixed a bug with local previews where a preview page could show up instead of
the Bricolage UI. Thanks to Sara for the spot. [David]

=item *

Fixed a bug where Mason component calls failed in previews when the
PREVIEW_MASON directive was enabled. [David]

=item *

Changed default value for text area fields added via the form builder (i.e., in
Contributor Type and Element profiles) to 0. The values 0 and "" always make the
the new field unlimited in length. [David]

=item *

Fixed a couple of buttons to be proper case rather than upper case. [David]

=item *

Separated the filesystem destinations for assets burned for publication and for
assets burned for previewing. This will prevent someone previewing and stomping
all over a published version of an asset before the published version is
distributed. [David]

=item *

Removed hard-coding of the local preview directory in httpd.conf and
httpd-ssl.conf. Now using the values stored in PREVIEW_LOCAL, instead, to
determine the proper directory. [David]

=item *

Added the DEF_MEDIA_TYPE directive. Bricolage will use the value in this
directive to assign a Media Type to all file resources if Bricolage can't
figure it out from their file extensions. This fixes a bug where Bricolage would
choke if it couldn't figure out the MediaType itself. [David]

=back

##############################################################################

=head1 Version 1.0.2 (2001-12-10)

=head2 New Features

=over

=item *

Added "File Name" and "File Extension" properties to OutputChannels. These
properties will now be used to name files burned to the file system on
preview and publish. [David]

=item *

Added DEFAULT_FILENAME and DEFAULT_FILE_EXT configuration directives to set
default values on the "File Name" and "File Extension" Output Channel
properties. [David]

=item *

Changed Bric::Util::Burner->display_element() so that it doesn't paginate. All
paginated pages are now treated instead as regular elements. This is useful for
things like printer-friendly pages. Bric::Util::Burner->display_element()
continues to work as before. Use this method to output a separate file for each
paginated element. [David]

=item *

When errors occur while previewing stories, the leftNav is now turned off.
[David]

=item *

Browser buttons and menus are now disabled. [David]

=item *

Added ability to set permissions on assets based on the categories they're in.
[David]

=item *

Moved all session and session locking files into the "bricolage" subdirectory of
the local file system's tmp directory. You'll want to rm -rf /tmp/bricolage_*
upon upgrading. [David]

=item *

Moved the location of cache files to the "bricolage/cache" subdirectory of the
local file system's tmp directory. You'll want to rm -rf /tmp/FileCache upon
upgrading. Together with the above change, this means that all Bricolage
temporary files are stored in the "bricolage" subdirectory of the local tmp,
e.g., /tmp/bricolage. [David]

=item *

Added new program, bric_clean_tmp, that can be used in a cron job to delete
stale temporary files. [Sam]

=item *

Added an "About" page, linked from the logo graphic, that explains the name
"Bricolage" and offers the license and credits. [David]

=item *

Added PERL_LOADER configuration directive. Pass a line of Perl to this
directive, and on startup, it'll execute it in the same namespace as your
templates execute in. [David]

=item *

Added INCLUDE_XML_WRITER and XML_WRITER_ARGS configuration parameters. If
INCLUDE_XML_WRITER is turned on, then all templates will include a new global,
$writer, that is an XML::Writer object. This object is provided as a convenience
for creating XML in your templates. XML_WRITER_ARGS allows certain arguments to
be passed to the XML::Writer. [David]

=item *

Fixed bug where data fields deleted from Elements were deleting them from
existing stories, too. [David]

=item *

Fixed bug where stories with related media associated with them were displaying
the story as an Element rather than as a story after editing the related media.
[David]

=item *

Removed all file system location dependencies for the operation of Bricolage.
Bricolage will still assume that everything's in /usr/local/bricolage, but any
location is fine as long as the BRICOLAGE_ROOT environment variable is set to
the proper location. [David]

=item *

Added code to force all preview pages to be re-requested from the server every
time they're viewed. This prevents the browser from loading older versions from
its cache, and allows users to always see the most recently-burned output of a
story. [David]

=item *

Removed debugging information from URLs for when debugging is turned off --
which should be always in production code (e.g., releases). [David]

=item *

Elements are now displayed with their display names rather than their attribute
names. Thanks to Sam Tregar for the spot. [David]

=item *

Fixed bug where fields (attributes) added to an Element with the name of an
existing but deactivated field triggered an error. Thanks to Sam for the
heads-up. [David]

=item *

Fixed a bug where data fields sometimes were not properly retrieved from the
database in Bric::Biz::AssetType. [David]

=item *

Fixed a bug where clicking "Save and Stay" in the Element profile wouldn't
delete attributes (fields) marked as such, or even delete the Element itself, if
the "Delete this profile" checkbox was checked.

=item *

Fixed a bug where, for Story and Media assets, editors were given Edit access to
notes, even when they didn't have the asset checked out. [David]

=item *

Changed the misleading and inaccurate "Two blank lines" label in the Bulk Edit
interface to the more accurate "One blank line". Thanks to Sam Tregar for the
heads-up.
