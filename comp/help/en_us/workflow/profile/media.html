<dd>Click this checkbox and then click "Save" to delete the media. Note:
    deleting a media does not expire (remove) the media from any of the

    search interface.</dd>

    it out).</dd>

<dt>Revert</dt>
<dd>Select an earlier version of the media from the menu and click this button
    to revert to that version. All changes made since that version were
    created will be removed. If you'd like to see what earlier versions looked
    like without reverting, select a version from the menu and click "View" to
    see the contents of the earlier version, or click "Diff" to see a
    change-tracking-style view of what has changed since the earlier
    version.</dd>
