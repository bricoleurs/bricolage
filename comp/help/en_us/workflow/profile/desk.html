<help page="Desks">

<p>The Desks structure allows you and other Bricolage users to share and
exchange assets.</p>

<p>After you create and save a new asset, it resides on your Workspace by
default. You can then check it in to a Desk to make it accessible to others in
your company's community. Once a user from one Desk edits and approves the
asset, he or she will move it to the next Desk and the process will repeat until
the asset is ready to be published.</p>

<p>A Desk looks and operates a lot like your Workspace -- it's just a common
space version. If a photograph media asset resides on the &quot;Art Desk,&quot;
as an example, any user who has access to the &quot;Art Desk&quot; will have
access to the photograph, though only one at a time can edit it.</p>

<dt>Check Out</dt>
<dd>Brings the asset to your Workspace to be edited. When an asset is checked
    out, it is still listed on the most recent Desk and can be viewed there, but
    may not be checked out to another user until it is first checked back in to
    the Desk. If the asset is checked out to another use, this the name of the
    user who has the asset checked out will be displayed, rather than this
    link.</dd>

<dt>Check In</dt>
<dd>If you see this option, it means that you have checked the asset out from
    this Desk to your Workspace. To let another user access and edit the
    asset, you'll need to click this link to check the asset back in to the
    Desk. Double-click to check in thes asset. Or click once to check in the
    asset and then do something else with it, such as move it to another desk,
    publish it (if you have permision), shelve it (to completely remove it
    from workflow), or revert it (to revert all changes made since you checked
    it out).</dd>
