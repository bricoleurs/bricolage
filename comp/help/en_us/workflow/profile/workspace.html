<help page="My Workspace">

<p>This is your home base. Here you will store all the documents and templates
(collectively known as <q>assets</q>) you create before checking them in to a
desk. You'll also be able to check assets out from other desks to edit them
from your workspace.</p>

<p>Click <em>My Workspace</em> in the upper left hand corner to return to this
screen at any time.</p>

<h3>Documents and Templates</h3>

<p>You can manage three different types of assets in your workspace: media
documents, story documents, and formatting templates. Newly created assets will
reside in your workspace until you move them—or check them in—to a desk.</p>

<p>By checking an asset into a desk, you allow other users to access it. Desks
are like stations in an assembly line—an asset needs to be approved by each
one before it is ready to ship out to consumers.</p>

<p>For example, let's say you have created a new article for your Web site.
You check it in to the <q>Edit Desk,</q> where an editor examines its
structure and accuracy. The editor then checks the article in to the <q>Legal
Desk,</q> where a lawyer makes sure it will not get you sued. Next it goes to
the <q>Copy Desk</q> to be scrutinized for grammar and spelling. And finally,
it is checked in to the <q>Publish Desk,</q> where you can push it to the
site.</p>

<p>At each of these points, the person who needs to edit the article will
check it out, or move it to his or her workspace. When an document or template
on a desk is checked out to a user, it remains listed on that Desk and other
users can still view it, but only the person who has checked it out can edit
it.</p>

<p>Note that desks can be added and removed from a workflow by an
administrator, so the desks you see in the left navigation column for a
workflow may not correspond to the desk names we've used in this example.</p>

<h3>Asset Properties (on Workspace)</h3>

<dl>
<dt>Title</dt>
<dd>Click to preview the asset in another window (documents or media). A white
    <q>P</q> (for documents) or <q>D</q> (for templates) at the far end of the
    title field indicates that the asset has been published or, in the case of
    templates, deployed. If the <q>P</q> or <q>D</q>is on a red background, it
    means that the asset has been changed since the last time it was published
    or deployed.</dd>

<dt>Primary URI</dt>
<dd>The location where a document will be published. Does not apply to
    templates.</dd>

<dt>Cover Date/Deployed Date</dt>
<dd>The document cover date or, for templates, their deploy date. For
    templates that have not been deployed, the deployed date will be
    empty.</dd>

<dt>Story Type/Media Type</dt>
<dd>The story type or media type element that defines the structure of the
    document. Does not apply to templates.</dd>

<dt>Site</dt>
<dd>The site with which the asset is associated. Will not display if Bricolage
    manages a single site.</dd>

<dt>Output Channel</dt>
<dd>The output channel with which the template is associated. Output channels
    generally define a collection of templates that output content to a
    particular format, such as XHTML or RSS. Does not apply to documents</dd>

<dt>Priority</dt>
<dd>Tells users how urgently the asset should move through workflow.</dd>

<dt>Check in</dt>
<dd>Select the desired desk (or <q>and shelf</q>, to remove the asset from
    workflow) from this select list, scroll to the bottom of the page and
    click <em>Check In Assets.</em> You can check in more than one asset at a
    time.</dd>

<dt>Notes</dt>
<dd>View any editorial notes users have attached to the asset.</dd>

<dt>Trail/Log</dt>
<dd>Lists what Desks the asset has been checked in to and displays the 
    asset's event history.</dd>

<dt>Clone</dt>
<dd>Create a duplicate of the story. Applies only to stories</dd>

<dt>Delete</dt>
<dd>Deletes the asset. Note: deleting an asset does not expire (remove) the 
    asset from any of the destinations that it has been published to. 
    Deleted assets can be reactivated by using the <q>Include deleted</q> 
    option in the advanced search to find the asset, checking the
    <q>Reactivate</q> checkbox beside the asset, and selecting <q>Checkout</q>
    at the bottom of the search screen.
