<help page="My Workspace">

<p>This is your home base. Here you will store all the documents and templates
(collectively known as <q>assets</q>) you create before checking them in to a
desk. You'll also be able to check assets out from other desks to edit them
from your workspace.</p>

<p>Click <em>My Workspace</em> in the upper left hand corner to return to this
screen at any time.</p>

<h3>Documents and Templates</h3>

<p>You can manage three different types of assets in your workspace: media
documents, story documents, and formatting templates. Newly created assets will
reside in your workspace until you move them—or check them in—to a desk.</p>

<p>By checking an asset into a desk, you allow other users to access it. Desks
are like stations in an assembly line—an asset needs to be approved by each
one before it is ready to ship out to consumers.</p>

<p>For example, let's say you have created a new article for your Web site.
You check it in to the <q>Edit Desk,</q> where an editor examines its
structure and accuracy. The editor then checks the article in to the <q>Legal
Desk,</q> where a lawyer makes sure it will not get you sued. Next it goes to
the <q>Copy Desk</q> to be scrutinized for grammar and spelling. And finally,
it is checked in to the <q>Publish Desk,</q> where you can push it to the
site.</p>

<p>At each of these points, the person who needs to edit the article will
check it out, or move it to his or her workspace. When an document or template
on a desk is checked out to a user, it remains listed on that Desk and other
users can still view it, but only the person who has checked it out can edit
it.</p>

<p>Note that desks can be added and removed from a workflow by an
administrator, so the desks you see in the left navigation column for a
workflow may not correspond to the desk names we've used in this example.</p>

    templates, deployed. If the <q>P</q> or <q>D</q>is on a red background, it
    means that the asset has been changed since the last time it was published
    or deployed.</dd>

    from workflow), or revert it (to revert all changes made since you checked
    it out).</dd>

    option in the advanced search to find the asset, checking the
    <q>Reactivate</q> checkbox beside the asset, and selecting <q>Checkout</q>
