<help page="Group Permissions Profile">

<p>This is the Group Permissions Profile, where you grant permissions
   for a group of users to access members of groups of objects.
   Select any of the permissions types from the 'Pick a Permissions Type'.</p>

<p>For each permission, use the radio buttons (or select lists, if the
   Permissions Widget preference has been set to &quot;Select
   Lists&quot;) to select the desired level of access. In ascending order, the
   levels of access are: None (the default), Read, Edit, Create. The final
   choice, Deny, works as a privileges leash for users and overrules the
   permissions granting of all other Groups. So if user Hank Smith is a member
   of a Group that has Deny selected for the Media Workflow, he will not be
   able to read, edit or create Media even if he is a member of another Group
   that does have such access.</p>

<p>Permissions will seem complicated until you &quot;get it&quot; (and maybe even
   after that). You should start by reading the 'AUTHORIZATION' section of
   <a href="http://bricolagecms.org/docs/current/api/Bric::Security" onclick="var newWin = window.open('http://bricolagecms.org/docs/current/api/Bric::Security'); newWin.focus(true); return false;">Bric::Security</a>
   and then search for or ask questions on the bricolage-general mailing list.</p>
