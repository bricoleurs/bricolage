<help page="User Manager">

<p>This is where you create user accounts and establish access levels. A
user's access is determined by his or her membership in user groups. For
example, if you want user Mary Jones to be allowed to edit stories, you'll go
to her user profile and enter her into a user group that has story editing
permissions.
Study <a href="http://bricolagecms.org/docs/current/api/Bric::Security" onclick="var newWin = window.open(this.href); newWin.focus(true); return false;">Bric::Security</a> for details on permissions management.</p>
