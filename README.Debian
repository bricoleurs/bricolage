Bricolage Debian README
-----------------------

There are currently efforts going on to produce a native Debian package that
you can simply install with your favorite Debian package tool. Gerfried Fuchs
knows about the current status. There are/were already preliminary packages
available which were produced by Erich Schubert. You can find them at
<http://people.debian.org/~erich/bricolage/>. If you use this package, be sure
to follow the instructions in /usr/share/bricolage/README.Debian.

Any hints/comments/suggestions appreciated, you can reach Gerfried Fuchs at
<alfie@users.sourceforge.net>. Please give him some days time to react, he
tends to be overworked sometimes....

Bricolage has been tested on Debian's stable distribution (woody, 3.0). For
Bricolage 1.7.0 or later, HTML::Mason 1.23 or later is required, with STRONG
recommendation to use Perl 5.8.0. The old stable Debian (potato, 2.2) will not
work with Bricolage as it does not include Perl 5.6.

The following DEBs should be installed with apt-get before installing
Bricolage:

  apache-perl
  apache-dev
  postgresql
  postgresql-dev
  postgresql-server-dev-X.Y   # use your Postgresql version number
  expat
  unzip

For other Perl module packages see below. Once all dependencies have been
satisfied, make sure that you enter "yes" when asked by the installer whether
or not it should become the PostgreSQL system user, as the default Debian
PostgreSQL configuration requires it. See
http://www.depesz.com/index.php/2007/10/04/ident/ for a detailed explanation
of the issue.


SFTP Mover
----------

If you use the optional SFTP mover, you have to install Net::SFTP. I found
that this will work if you first install some of its prerequisite classes as
built by Debian:

    $ sudo apt-get install libnet-ssh-perl
    $ sudo apt-get install libstring-crc32-perl

There was no Net::SFTP installer from Debian, so proceed with

    $ sudo cpan install Net::SFTP


Amazon S3 Mover
---------------

If you use the optional Amazon S3 mover, you have to install
Net::Amazon::S3 by doing the following:

    $ sudo apt-get install libnet-amazon-s3-perl


Perl module dependencies

you prefer them over manual CPAN installation you can install as
