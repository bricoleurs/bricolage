# without a username. If your server requires a password, pass the
# PG_SUPERPASS environment variable during "make," e.g.:
#
#    make PG_SUPERPASS=abcdef

# connect to the database) is randomly generated during a silent install.  If

# IP address to "make" through the PG_HOSTNAME environment variable.
# If it's running on a port other than the default port (5432), pass the 
# appropriate port number with PG_HOSTPORT.
